# Chapter 3. Memory Ordering

<span id="index-memoryordering-2" class="indexterm"></span>
In [Chapter 2](atomics.html), we briefly touched upon the concept of *memory ordering*.
In this chapter, we’ll dive into this topic and explore all the available memory ordering options,
and, most importantly, when to use which one.

## Reordering and Optimizations

<span id="index-reorderinginstructions" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compileroptimization-reordering" class="indexterm"></span>
Processors and compilers perform all sorts of tricks to make your programs run as fast as possible.
A processor might determine that two particular consecutive instructions in your program
will not affect each other, and execute them *out of order*, if that is faster, for example.
While one instruction is briefly blocked on fetching some data from main memory,
several of the following instructions might be executed and finished before the first instruction finishes,
as long as that wouldn’t change the behavior of your program.
Similarly, a compiler might decide to reorder or rewrite parts of your program
if it has reason to believe it might result in faster execution.
But, again, only if that wouldn’t change the behavior of your program.

Let’s take a look at the following function as an example:

``` rust
fn f(a: &mut i32, b: &mut i32) {
    *a += 1;
    *b += 1;
    *a += 1;
}
```

Here, the compiler will most certainly understand that the order of these operations does not matter,
since nothing happens between these three addition operations that depends on
the value of `*a` or `*b`. (Assuming overflow checking is disabled.)
Because of that, it might reorder the second and third operations,
and then merge the first two into a single addition:

``` rust
fn f(a: &mut i32, b: &mut i32) {
    *a += 2;
    *b += 1;
}
```

Later, while executing this function of the optimized compiled program,
a processor might for a variety of reasons end up executing the second addition before the first addition,
possibly because `*b` was available in a cache, while `*a` had to be fetched from the main memory.

Regardless of these optimizations, the result stays the same: `*a` is incremented by two and `*b` is incremented by one.
The order in which they were incremented is entirely invisible to the rest of your program.

The logic for verifying that a specific reordering or other optimization won’t affect the behavior of your program
does not take other threads into account.
In our example above, that’s perfectly fine, as the unique references (`&mut i32`) guarantee that nothing else can possibly
access the values, making other threads irrelevant.
The only situation where this is a problem is when mutating data that’s shared between threads.
Or, in other words, when working with atomics.
This is why we have to explicitly tell the compiler and processor what they can and can’t do with our atomic operations,
since their usual logic ignores interactions between threads and might allow
for optimizations that do change the result of your program.

The interesting question is *how* we tell them.
If we wanted to precisely spell out exactly what is and isn’t acceptable,
concurrent programming might become exceedingly verbose and error prone,
and maybe even architecture-specific:
<span id="index-memoryordering-specifyingusingplainEnglish" class="indexterm"></span>

``` rust
let x = a.fetch_add(1,
    Dear compiler and processor,
    Feel free to reorder this with operations on b,
    but if there's another thread concurrently executing f,
    please don't reorder this with operations on c!
    Also, processor, don't forget to flush your store buffer!
    If b is zero, though, it doesn't matter.
    In that case, feel free to do whatever is fastest.
    Thanks~ <3
);
```

<span id="index-Ordering-2" class="indexterm"></span>
Instead, we can only pick from a small set of options,
represented by the `std::sync::atomic::Ordering` enum,
which every atomic operation takes as an argument.
The set of available options is very limited,
but has been carefully picked to fit most use cases well.
The orderings are very abstract and do not directly reflect
the actual compiler and processor mechanisms involved, such as instruction reordering.
This makes it possible for your concurrent code to be architecture-independent and future-proof.
It allows for verification without knowing the details of every single current and future
processor and compiler version.

The available orderings in Rust are:

- Relaxed ordering: `Ordering::Relaxed`

- Release and acquire ordering: `Ordering::{Release, Acquire, AcqRel}`

- Sequentially consistent ordering: `Ordering::SeqCst`

In C++, there is also something called *consume ordering*,
which has been purposely omitted from Rust, but is nonetheless interesting to discuss as well.

## The Memory Model

<span id="index-memorymodel" class="indexterm"></span>
The different memory ordering options have a strict formal definition to make sure we know exactly what we’re allowed to assume,
and for compiler writers to know exactly what guarantees they need to provide to us.
To decouple this from the details of specific processor architectures,
memory ordering is defined in terms of an abstract *memory model*.

Rust’s memory model, which is mostly copied from C++,
doesn’t match any existing processor architecture,
but instead is an abstract model with a strict set of rules that attempt to represent the greatest common denominator of all current and future architectures,
while also giving the compiler enough freedom to make useful assumptions while analyzing and optimizing programs.

We’ve already seen a part of the memory model in action in ["Borrowing and Data Races" in Chapter 1](basics.html#borrowing-and-races),
where we talked about how data races result in undefined behavior.
Rust’s memory model allows for concurrent atomic stores,
but considers concurrent non-atomic stores to the same variable to be a data race,
resulting in undefined behavior.
<span id="index-dataraces-avoidingusingatomics-2" class="indexterm"></span>

<span id="index-atomic-loadandstoreoperations-comparedtonon-atomicoperations" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-loadandstoreoperationsatomic-comparedtonon-atomicoperations" class="indexterm"></span>
On most processor architectures, however, there is actually no difference between an
atomic store and a regular non-atomic store, as we’ll see in [Chapter 7](hardware.html).
One could argue that the memory model is more restrictive than necessary,
but these strict rules make it easier to reason about a program,
both for the compiler and the programmer,
and they leave space for future developments.

## Happens-Before Relationship

<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-happens-beforerelationship" class="indexterm"></span>
The memory model defines the order in which operations happen in terms of *happens-before relationships*.
This means that as an abstract model, it doesn’t talk about machine instructions, caches,
buffers, timing, instruction reordering, compiler optimizations, and so on,
but instead only defines situations where one thing is guaranteed to happen before another thing,
and leaves the order of everything else undefined.

<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-withinthesamethread" class="indexterm"></span>
The basic happens-before rule is that everything that happens within the same thread happens in order.
If a thread is executing `f(); g();`, then `f()` *happens-before* `g()`.

<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-betweenthreads" class="indexterm"></span>
Between threads, however, happens-before relationships only occur in a few specific cases,
such as when spawning and joining a thread,
unlocking and locking a mutex,
and through atomic operations that use non-relaxed memory ordering.
`Relaxed` memory ordering is the most basic (and most performant) memory ordering that,
by itself, never results in any cross-thread happens-before relationships.

To explore what that means, let’s take a look at the following example
where we assume `a` and `b` are concurrently executed by different threads:

``` rust
static X: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);
static Y: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);

fn a() {
    X.store(10, Relaxed); 1
    Y.store(20, Relaxed); 2
}

fn b() {
    let y = Y.load(Relaxed); 3
    let x = X.load(Relaxed); 4
    println!("{x} {y}");
}
```

As mentioned above, the basic happens-before rule is that everything that
happens within the same thread happens in order.
In this case: <span class="callout">1</span> happens-before <span class="callout">2</span>, and <span class="callout">3</span> happens-before <span class="callout">4</span>, as shown in [Figure 3-1](#happens-before-diagram-load-store).
Since we use relaxed memory ordering, there are no other happens-before relationships in our example.

<figure id="happens-before-diagram-load-store">
<div class="image">

</div>
<figcaption>Figure 3-1. The happens-before relationships between atomic operations in the <span>example code</span>. <a href="alt/3-1.html" class="desc"><img src="desc.svg" title="Image description" alt="Image description" /></a></figcaption>
</figure>

If either of `a` or `b` completes before the other starts, the output will be `0 0` or `10 20`.
If `a` and `b` run concurrently, it’s easy to see how the output can be `10 0`.
One way this can happen is if the operations run in this order: <span class="callout">3</span> <span class="callout">1</span> <span class="callout">2</span> <span class="callout">4</span>.

<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-counter-intuitiveresults" class="indexterm"></span>
More interestingly, the output can also be `0 20`,
even though there is no possible globally consistent order of the four operations that would result in this outcome.
When <span class="callout">3</span> is executed, there is no happens-before relationship with <span class="callout">2</span>,
which means it could load either 0 or 20.
When <span class="callout">4</span> is executed, there is no happens-before relationship with <span class="callout">1</span>,
which means it could load either 0 or 10.
Given this, the output `0 20` is a valid outcome.

The important and counter-intuitive thing to understand is that
operation <span class="callout">3</span> loading the value 20 does *not* result in a happens-before relationship with <span class="callout">2</span>,
even though that value is the one stored by <span class="callout">2</span>.
Our intuitive understanding of the concept of "before" breaks down
when things don’t necessarily happen in a globally consistent order,
such as when instruction reordering is involved.

A more practical and intuitive, but less formal, understanding is that from the perspective of the thread executing `b`,
operations <span class="callout">1</span> and <span class="callout">2</span> might appear to happen in the opposite order.

### Spawning and Joining

<span id="index-spawningthreads-happens-beforerelationship" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-spawningandjoiningthreads" class="indexterm"></span>
Spawning a thread creates a happens-before relationship between
what happened before the `spawn()` call, and the new thread.
<span id="index-joiningthreads-happens-beforerelationship" class="indexterm"></span>
Similarly, joining a thread creates a happens-before relationship between
the joined thread and what happens after the `join()` call.

To demonstrate, the assertion in the following example cannot fail:

``` rust
static X: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);

fn main() {
    X.store(1, Relaxed);
    let t = thread::spawn(f);
    X.store(2, Relaxed);
    t.join().unwrap();
    X.store(3, Relaxed);
}

fn f() {
    let x = X.load(Relaxed);
    assert!(x == 1 || x == 2);
}
```

Because of the happens-before relationships formed by the join and spawn operations,
we know for sure that the load from `X` happens after the first store, but before the last store,
as visualized in [Figure 3-2](#happens-before-diagram-spawn-join).
However, whether it observes the value before or after the second store is unpredictable.
In other words, it could load either 1 or 2, but not 0 or 3.

<figure id="happens-before-diagram-spawn-join">
<div class="image">

</div>
<figcaption>Figure 3-2. The happens-before relationships between the spawn, join, store, and load operations in the example code. <a href="alt/3-2.html" class="desc"><img src="desc.svg" title="Image description" alt="Image description" /></a></figcaption>
</figure>

## Relaxed Ordering

<span id="index-Ordering-Relaxed-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-3" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-relaxed-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-totalmodificationorder" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-totalmodificationorder" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-totalmodificationorder" class="indexterm"></span>
While atomic operations using relaxed memory ordering do not provide any happens-before relationship,
they do guarantee a *total modification order* of each individual atomic variable.
This means that all modifications *of the same atomic variable*
happen in an order that is the same from the perspective of every single thread.

To demonstrate what that means, consider the following example
where we assume `a` and `b` are concurrently executed by different threads:

``` rust
static X: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);

fn a() {
    X.fetch_add(5, Relaxed);
    X.fetch_add(10, Relaxed);
}

fn b() {
    let a = X.load(Relaxed);
    let b = X.load(Relaxed);
    let c = X.load(Relaxed);
    let d = X.load(Relaxed);
    println!("{a} {b} {c} {d}");
}
```

In this example, only one thread modifies `X`,
which makes it easy to see that there’s only one possible order of modification of `X`: 0→5→15.
It starts at zero, then becomes five, and is finally changed to fifteen.
Threads cannot observe any values from `X` that are inconsistent with this total modification order.
This means that `"0 0 0 0"`, `"0 0 5 15"`, and `"0 15 15 15"` are some of the
possible results from the print statement in the other thread,
while an output of `"0 5 0 15"` or `"0 0 10 15"` is impossible.

Even if there’s more than one possible order of modification for an atomic variable,
all threads will agree on a single order.

Let’s replace `a` by two separate functions, `a1` and `a2`,
which we assume are each executed by a separate thread:

``` rust
fn a1() {
    X.fetch_add(5, Relaxed);
}

fn a2() {
    X.fetch_add(10, Relaxed);
}
```

Assuming these are the only threads modifying `X`,
there are now two possible modification orders:
either 0→5→15, or 0→10→15, depending on which `fetch_add` operation executes first.
Whichever happens, all threads observe the same order.
So, even if we have hundreds of additional threads all running our `b()` function,
we know that if one of them prints a `10`,
the order must be 0→10→15 and none of them can possibly print a `5`.
And vice versa.

In [Chapter 2](atomics.html), we saw several examples of use cases
where this total modification order guarantee for individual variables is enough,
making relaxed memory ordering sufficient.
However, if we try anything more advanced beyond those examples,
we’ll quickly see we need something stronger than relaxed memory ordering.

### Out-of-Thin-Air Values

<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-out-of-thin-airvalues" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-out-of-thin-airvalues" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-out-of-thin-airvalues" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-thinairoutof" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-airoutofthin" class="indexterm"></span>
The lack of ordering guarantees around relaxed memory ordering
can lead to some theoretical complications when operations
depend on each other in a cyclic way.

To demonstrate, here’s a contrived example where two threads load a value from
one atomic and store it in the other:

``` rust
static X: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);
static Y: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);

fn main() {
    let a = thread::spawn(|| {
        let x = X.load(Relaxed);
        Y.store(x, Relaxed);
    });
    let b = thread::spawn(|| {
        let y = Y.load(Relaxed);
        X.store(y, Relaxed);
    });
    a.join().unwrap();
    b.join().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(X.load(Relaxed), 0); // Might fail?
    assert_eq!(Y.load(Relaxed), 0); // Might fail?
}
```

It seems easy to conclude that the values of `X` and `Y` will never be anything other than zero,
since the store operations only store values that were loaded from these same atomics,
which are only ever zero.

If we strictly follow the theoretical memory model, however,
we have to come to terms with our cyclic reasoning,
and come to the scary conclusion that we might be wrong.
In fact, the memory model technically allows for an outcome where both `X` and `Y`
are 37 in the end, or any other value, making the assertions fail.

Due to the lack of ordering guarantees, the load operations of these two threads
might *both* see the result of the store operation of the other thread,
allowing for a cycle in the order of operations:
we store 37 in `Y` because we loaded 37 from `X`,
which was stored to `X` because we loaded 37 from `Y`,
which is the value we stored in `Y`.

Fortunately, the possibility of such *out-of-thin-air* values
is universally considered to be a bug in the theoretical model,
and not something you need to take into account in practice.
The theoretical problem of how to formalize relaxed memory ordering
without the model allowing for such anomalies is an unsolved one.
<span id="index-ignoranceblissful" class="indexterm"></span>
While this is an eyesore for formal verification that keeps many theoreticians up at night,
the rest of us can relax in blissful ignorance knowing that this does not happen in practice.

## Release and Acquire Ordering

<span id="index-memoryordering-releaseandacquire" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-Ordering-Acquire" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-Ordering-Release" class="indexterm"></span> *Release* and *acquire* memory ordering are used in a pair to form a happens-before relationship between threads.
`Release` memory ordering applies to store operations,
while `Acquire` memory ordering applies to load operations.

<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-througharelease-acquirepair" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-happens-beforerelationship-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-happens-beforerelationship" class="indexterm"></span>
A happens-before relationship is formed
when an acquire-load operation observes the result of a release-store operation.
In this case, the store and everything before it, happened before
the load and everything after it.

When using `Acquire` for a fetch-and-modify or compare-and-exchange operation,
it applies only to the part of the operation that loads the value.
Similarly, `Release` applies only to the store part of an operation.
`AcqRel` is used to represent the combination of `Acquire` and `Release`,
which causes both the load to use acquire ordering, and the store to use release ordering.
<span id="index-Ordering-AcqRel" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-AcqRel" class="indexterm"></span>

Let’s go over an example to see how that’s used in practice.
In the following example, we send a 64-bit integer from a spawned thread to the main thread.
We use an extra atomic boolean to indicate to the main thread that the integer
has been stored and is ready to be read.

``` rust
use std::sync::atomic::Ordering::{Acquire, Release};

static DATA: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);
static READY: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        DATA.store(123, Relaxed);
        READY.store(true, Release); // Everything from before this store ..
    });
    while !READY.load(Acquire) { // .. is visible after this loads `true`.
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!("waiting...");
    }
    println!("{}", DATA.load(Relaxed));
}
```

When the spawned thread is done storing the data,
it uses a release-store to set the `READY` flag to `true`.
When the main thread observes this through its acquire-load operation,
a happens-before relationship is established between those two operations,
as shown in [Figure 3-3](#happens-before-diagram-release-acquire).
At that point, we know for sure that everything that happened before the release-store to `READY`
is visible to everything that happens after the acquire-load.
Specifically, when the main thread loads from `DATA`,
we know for sure it will load the value stored by the background thread.
There’s only one possible outcome this program can print on its last line: `123`.

<figure id="happens-before-diagram-release-acquire">
<div class="image">

</div>
<figcaption>Figure 3-3. The happens-before relationships between atomic operations in the example code, showing the cross-thread relationship formed by the acquire and release operations. <a href="alt/3-3.html" class="desc"><img src="desc.svg" title="Image description" alt="Image description" /></a></figcaption>
</figure>

If we had used relaxed memory ordering for all operations in this example,
the main thread could have seen `READY` flip to `true`, while still loading
a zero from `DATA` afterwards.

<div class="admonition admonition-tip">

**Tip**

The names "release" and "acquire" are based on their most basic use case:
one thread *releases* data by atomically storing some value to an atomic variable,
and another thread *acquires* it by atomically loading that value.
This is exactly what happens when we unlock (release) a mutex
and subsequently lock (acquire) it on another thread.

</div>

In our example, the happens-before relationship from the `READY` flag guarantees that
the store and load operations of `DATA` cannot happen concurrently.
This means that we don’t actually need those operations to be atomic.

However, if we simply try to use a regular non-atomic type for our data variable,
the compiler will refuse our program, since Rust’s type system doesn’t allow us to
mutate those from one thread when another thread is also borrowing them.
The type system does not magically understand the happens-before relationship
we’ve created here.
Some `unsafe` code is necessary to promise to the compiler that we’ve thought
about this carefully and we’re sure we’re not breaking any rules, as follows:

``` rust
static mut DATA: u64 = 0;
static READY: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

fn main() {
    thread::spawn(|| {
        // Safety: Nothing else is accessing DATA,
        // because we haven't set the READY flag yet.
        unsafe { DATA = 123 };
        READY.store(true, Release); // Everything from before this store ..
    });
    while !READY.load(Acquire) { // .. is visible after this loads `true`.
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(100));
        println!("waiting...");
    }
    // Safety: Nothing is mutating DATA, because READY is set.
    println!("{}", unsafe { DATA });
}
```

### More Formally

<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-througharelease-acquirepair-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-happens-beforerelationship-2" class="indexterm"></span>
A happens-before relationship is formed
when an acquire-load operation observes the result of a release-store operation. But what does that mean?

Imagine that two threads both release-store a seven into the same atomic variable,
and a third thread loads a seven from that variable.
Does the third thread now have a happens-before relationship with the first thread or the second one?
That depends on "which seven" it loaded: the one from thread one or the one from thread two.
(Or perhaps an unrelated seven.)
This leads us to the conclusion that even though seven equals seven,
there is something different about the two sevens from the two threads.

The way to think about this is in terms of the *total modification order*
that we talked about in ["Relaxed Ordering"](#relaxed): the ordered list of all modifications
that happen to an atomic variable.
<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-totalmodificationorder-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-totalmodificationorder-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-totalmodificationorder-2" class="indexterm"></span>
Even if the same value is written to the same variable more than once,
each of these operations represents a separate event in the total modification order of that variable.
When we load a value, the value loaded matches a specific point on this per-variable "timeline," which tells us which operation we might be synchronizing with.

For example, if the total modification order of the atomic is

1.  Initialized at 0

2.  *Release*-store 7 (from thread two)

3.  Relaxed-store 6

4.  *Release*-store 7 (from thread one)

then acquire-loading a 7 would synchronize with either the release-store from the second event, or the release-store from the last event.
However, if we have previously (in terms of happens-before relationships) seen a 6,
we know we’re seeing the last 7, not the first one,
meaning we now have a happens-before relationship with thread one, and not with thread two.

<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-througharelease-acquirepair-chaining" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-happens-beforerelationship-chaining" class="indexterm"></span>
There is one extra detail, which is that a release-stored value may be modified by
any number of fetch-and-modify and compare-and-exchange operations,
while still resulting in a happens-before relationship with an acquire-load that reads the final result.

For example, imagine an atomic variable with the following total modification order:

1.  Initialized at 0

2.  *Release*-store 7

3.  Relaxed-fetch-and-add 1, changing 7 to 8

4.  *Release*-fetch-and-add 1, changing 8 to 9

5.  *Release*-store 7

6.  Relaxed-swap 10, changing 7 to 10

Now, if we acquire-load a 9 from this variable, we not only establish a happens-before relationship
with the fourth operation (that stored this value), but also with the second operation (which stored a 7),
even though the third operation used relaxed memory ordering.

Similarly, if we acquire-load a 10 from this variable, which was written by a relaxed operation,
we still establish a happens-before relationship with the fifth operation (which stored a 7).
Because that was just a regular store operation
(not a fetch-and-modify or compare-and-exchange operation),
it breaks the chain: we don’t establish a happens-before relationship with any of the other operations.

### Example: Locking

<span id="index-AtomicBool-lockingusing" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-mutexes-memoryordering" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-lockingandunlocking" class="indexterm"></span>
Mutexes are the most common use case for release and acquire ordering (see ["Locking: Mutexes and RwLocks" in Chapter 1](basics.html#mutexes)).
When locking, they use an atomic operation to check if it was unlocked, using acquire ordering,
while also (atomically) changing the state to "locked."
When unlocking, they set the state back to "unlocked" using release ordering.
This means that there will be a happens-before relationship between unlocking a mutex and subsequently locking it.
<span id="index-happens-beforerelationships-lockingandunlocking" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-mutexes-happens-beforerelationship" class="indexterm"></span>

Here’s a demonstration of this pattern:

``` rust
static mut DATA: String = String::new();
static LOCKED: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

fn f() {
    if LOCKED.compare_exchange(false, true, Acquire, Relaxed).is_ok() {
        // Safety: We hold the exclusive lock, so nothing else is accessing DATA.
        unsafe { DATA.push('!') };
        LOCKED.store(false, Release);
    }
}

fn main() {
    thread::scope(|s| {
        for _ in 0..100 {
            s.spawn(f);
        }
    });
}
```

<span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-memoryordering" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-atomic-compare-and-exchangeoperations-memoryordering" class="indexterm"></span>
As we’ve briefly seen in ["Compare-and-Exchange Operations" in Chapter 2](atomics.html#cas), compare-and-exchange operations take two memory ordering arguments:
one for the case where the comparison succeeded and the store happened,
and one for the case where the comparison failed and the store did not happen.
In `f`, we attempt to change `LOCKED` from `false` to `true`,
and only access `DATA` if that succeeds.
So, we only care about the success memory ordering.
If the `compare_exchange` operation fails,
that must be because `LOCKED` was already set to `true`,
in which case `f` doesn’t do anything.
This matches the `try_lock` operation on a regular mutex.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

An observant reader might have already noticed that the compare-and-exchange operation could
also have been a swap operation, since swapping `true` for `true` when already locked
doesn’t change the correctness of the code:

``` rust
// This also works.
if LOCKED.swap(true, Acquire) == false {
    …
}
```

</div>

Thanks to the acquire and release memory ordering, we know for sure that
no two threads can concurrently access `DATA`.
As visualized in [Figure 3-4](#happens-before-diagram-lock-unlock),
any previous access to `DATA` happened-before the subsequent release-store of `false` to `LOCKED`,
which in turn happened-before the next acquire-compare-and-exchange (or acquire-swap)
operation that changed that `false` to `true`, which happened-before the next access to `DATA`.

In [Chapter 4](building-spinlock.html) we’ll turn this concept into a reusable type: a spin lock.

### Example: Lazy Initialization with Indirection

<span id="index-lazyinitialization-usingcompareexchangeandallocation" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-examplelazyinitialization" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-examplelazyinitialization-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-atomic-compare-and-exchangeoperations-examplelazyinitialization-2" class="indexterm"></span>
In ["Example: Lazy One-Time Initialization" in Chapter 2](atomics.html#example-racy-init), we implemented lazy initialization
of a global variable, using a compare-and-exchange operation
to handle situations where multiple threads race to initialize
the value concurrently.
Because the value was a nonzero 64-bit integer,
we were able to use an `AtomicU64` to store it,
using zero as the placeholder before initializing it.

To do the same for a much larger data type that does not fit in a single atomic variable,
we need to look for an alternative.

For this example, let’s say we want to maintain the non-blocking behavior,
so that threads never wait for another thread, but instead race and take the
value from the first thread to complete initialization.
This means we still need to be able to go from "uninitialized"
to "fully initialized" in a single atomic operation.

As the fundamental theorem of software engineering tells us,
every problem in computer science can be solved by adding another layer of indirection,
and this problem is no different.
Since we can’t fit the data into a single atomic variable,
we can instead use an atomic variable to store *a pointer* to the data.

<span id="index-AtomicPtr-lazyinitialization" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-AtomicPtr-compare-and-exchange" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-usingonAtomicPtr" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-atomic-compare-and-exchangeoperations-usingonAtomicPtr" class="indexterm"></span>
An `AtomicPtr<T>` is the atomic version of a `*mut T`: a pointer to `T`.
We can use a null pointer as the placeholder for the initial state,
and use a compare-and-exchange operation to atomically replace it with
a pointer to a newly allocated, fully initialized `T`,
which can then be read by the other threads.

Since we’re not only sharing the atomic variable containing the pointer,
but also the data it points to,
we can no longer use relaxed memory ordering like in [Chapter 2](atomics.html).
We need to make sure that allocating and initializing the data
does not race with reading it.
In other words, we need to use release and acquire ordering on the
store and load operations, to make sure the compiler and processor
won’t break our code by—​for example—​reordering
the store of the pointer and the initialization of the data itself.

This leads us to the following implementation,
for some arbitrary data type called `Data`:

``` rust
use std::sync::atomic::AtomicPtr;

fn get_data() -> &'static Data {
    static PTR: AtomicPtr<Data> = AtomicPtr::new(std::ptr::null_mut());

    let mut p = PTR.load(Acquire);

    if p.is_null() {
        p = Box::into_raw(Box::new(generate_data()));
        if let Err(e) = PTR.compare_exchange(
            std::ptr::null_mut(), p, Release, Acquire
        ) {
            // Safety: p comes from Box::into_raw right above,
            // and wasn't shared with any other thread.
            drop(unsafe { Box::from_raw(p) });
            p = e;
        }
    }

    // Safety: p is not null and points to a properly initialized value.
    unsafe { &*p }
}
```

If the pointer we acquire-load from `PTR` is non-null,
we assume it points to the already initialized data,
and construct a reference to that data.

If it’s still null, however, we generate new data and store it in a new allocation using `Box::new`.
We then turn this `Box` into a raw pointer using `Box::into_raw`,
so we can attempt to store it into `PTR` using a compare-and-exchange operation.
<span id="index-Box-intoraw" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-Box-fromraw" class="indexterm"></span>
If another thread wins the initialization race, `compare_exchange` fails as `PTR` is no longer null.
If that happens, we turn our raw pointer back into a `Box` to deallocate it using `drop`,
avoiding a memory leak, and continue with the pointer that the other thread stored in `PTR`.

The safety comment on the final `unsafe` block states our assumption that the data it points to has already been initialized.
Note how this includes an assumption about the order in which things happened.
To make sure our assumption holds, we use release and acquire memory ordering to make sure initializing the data
has actually *happened-before* creating a reference to it.

We load a potentially non-null (i.e., initialized) pointer in two places: through the `load` operation and through the `compare_exchange` operation when it fails.
So, as explained above, we need to use `Acquire` for both the `load` memory ordering and the `compare_exchange` failure memory ordering,
to be able to synchronize with the operation that stores the pointer.
This store happens when the `compare_exchange` operation succeeds,
so we must use `Release` as its success ordering.

[Figure 3-5](#happens-before-diagram-racy-init) shows a visualization of the operations and happens-before relationships
for a situation in which three threads call `get_data()`.
In this situation, thread A and B both observe a null pointer and both attempt to initialize the
atomic pointer. Thread A wins that race, causing thread B’s `compare_exchange` operation to fail.
Thread C only observes the atomic pointer after it has been initialized by thread A.
The end result is that all three threads end up using the box that was allocated by thread A.

## Consume Ordering

<span id="index-memoryordering-consume" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-consumememoryordering" class="indexterm"></span>
Let’s take a closer look at the memory ordering in our last example.
If we leave the strict memory model aside and think of it in more practical terms,
we could say that the release ordering prevents the initialization of the data
from being reordered with the store operation that shares the pointer with the other threads.
This is important, since otherwise other threads might be able to see the data before it’s fully initialized.

Similarly, we could explain the acquire ordering as preventing reordering that would cause the data to be accessed before the pointer is loaded.
One might reasonably wonder, however, if that makes any sense in practice.
How could the data be accessed before its address is known?
We might conclude that something weaker than acquire ordering might suffice.
And we would be right: this weaker ordering is called *consume ordering*.

Consume ordering is basically a lightweight—​more efficient—​variant of acquire ordering,
whose synchronizing effects are limited to things that *depend on* the loaded value.

What that means is that if you consume-load a release-stored value `x` from an atomic variable, then,
basically, that store happened before the evaluation of *dependent* expressions
like `*x`, `array[x]` or `table.lookup(x + 1)`,
but *not* necessarily before independent operations,
like reading another variable that we don’t need the value of `x` for.

Now there’s good news and bad news.

The good news is that—​on all modern processor architectures—​consume ordering is achieved
with the exact same instructions as relaxed ordering.
In other words, consume ordering can be "free," which—​at least on some platforms—​is not the case for acquire ordering.

The bad news is that no compiler actually implements consume ordering.

As it turns out, not only is this concept of a "dependent" evaluation hard to define,
it’s even harder to keep such dependencies intact while transforming and optimizing a program.
For example, a compiler might be able to optimize `x + 2 - x` to just `2`, effectively dropping the dependency on `x`.
More subtle variations of this issue can happen with more realistic expressions like `array[x]`,
if the compiler is able to make any logical deductions about the possible values of `x` or the array’s elements.
The issue gets even more complicated when taking control flow into account, like `if` statements or function calls.

Because of this, compilers upgrade consume ordering to acquire ordering, just to be safe.
The C++20 standard even explicitly discourages the use of consume ordering,
noting that an implementation other than just acquire ordering turned out to be infeasible.

<span id="index-Ordering-Consume" class="indexterm"></span>
It’s possible that a workable definition and implementation of consume ordering might be found in the future.
Until that time arrives, however, Rust does not expose `Ordering::Consume`.

## Sequentially Consistent Ordering

<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-sequentiallyconsistent" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-Ordering-SeqCst" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-globallyconsistentorder" class="indexterm"></span>
The strongest memory ordering is *sequentially consistent* ordering: `Ordering::SeqCst`.
It includes all the guarantees of acquire ordering (for loads) and release ordering (for stores),
and *also* guarantees a globally consistent order of operations.

This means that every single operation using `SeqCst` ordering within a program
is part of a single total order that all threads agree on.
This total order is consistent with the total modification order of each individual variable.

Since it is strictly stronger than acquire and release memory ordering,
a sequentially consistent load or store can take the place of an acquire-load or release-store in a
release-acquire pair to form a happens-before relationship.
In other words, an acquire-load can not only form a happens-before relationship with a release-store,
but also with a sequentially consistent store, and similarly the other way around.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

Only when both sides of a happens-before relationship use `SeqCst` ordering
is it guaranteed to be consistent with the single total order of `SeqCst` operations.

</div>

While it might seem like the easiest memory ordering to reason about, `SeqCst` ordering is almost never necessary in practice.
In nearly all cases, regular acquire and release ordering suffice.

Here’s an example that depends on sequentially consistent ordered operations:

``` rust
use std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst;

static A: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);
static B: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);

static mut S: String = String::new();

fn main() {
    let a = thread::spawn(|| {
        A.store(true, SeqCst);
        if !B.load(SeqCst) {
            unsafe { S.push('!') };
        }
    });

    let b = thread::spawn(|| {
        B.store(true, SeqCst);
        if !A.load(SeqCst) {
            unsafe { S.push('!') };
        }
    });

    a.join().unwrap();
    b.join().unwrap();
}
```

Both threads first set their own atomic boolean to `true` to warn the other
thread that they are about to access `S`, and then check the other’s atomic boolean
to see if they can safely access `S` without causing a data race.

If both store operations happen before either of the load operations,
it’s possible that neither thread ends up accessing `S`.
However, it’s impossible for *both* threads to access `S` and cause undefined behavior,
since the sequentially consistent ordering guarantees only one of them can win the race.
In every possible single total order, the first operation will be a store operation,
which prevents the other thread from accessing `S`.

Virtually all real-world uses of `SeqCst` involve a similar pattern of a store
that must be globally visible before a subsequent load on the same thread.
For these situations, a potentially more efficient alternative is to instead
use relaxed operations in combination with a `SeqCst` *fence*, which we’ll explore next.

## Fences

<span id="index-memoryordering-fences" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-fences" class="indexterm"></span>
In addition to operations on atomic variables, there is one more thing that we can apply a memory ordering to: atomic fences.

<span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-releasefence" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-acquirefence" class="indexterm"></span>
The `std::sync::atomic::fence` function represents an *atomic fence* and is either a *release fence* (`Release`),
an *acquire fence* (`Acquire`), or both (`AcqRel` or `SeqCst`).
A `SeqCst` fence additionally also takes part in the sequentially consistent total order.

An atomic fence allows you to separate the memory ordering from the atomic operation.
This can be useful if you want to apply a memory ordering to multiple operations,
or if you only want to apply it conditionally.

In essence, a release-store can be split into a release fence followed by a (relaxed) store,
and an acquire-load can be split into a (relaxed) load followed by an acquire fence:

<figure class="table">
<table class="without-headers">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</figure>

Using a separate fence can result in an extra processor instruction, though,
which can be slightly less efficient.

More importantly, unlike a release-store or an acquire-load, a fence is not tied to any single atomic variable.
This means that a single fence can be used for multiple variables at once.

Formally, a release fence can take the place of a release operation in a happens-before relationship
if that release fence is followed (on the same thread) by any atomic operation that stores
a value observed by the acquire operation we’re synchronizing with.
Similarly, an acquire fence can take the place of any acquire operation
if that acquire fence is preceded (on the same thread) by any atomic operation that loads
a value stored by the release operation.

Putting this together, it means that a happens-before relationship is created between a release fence and an acquire fence
if *any* store after the release fence is observed by *any* load before the acquire fence.

For example, suppose we have one thread executing a release fence followed by
three atomic store operations to different variables,
and another thread executing three load operations from those same variables followed by an acquire fence, as follows:

<figure class="table">
<table class="without-headers">

</figure>

In this situation, if *any* of the load operations on thread 2 loads the value from the corresponding store operation of thread 1,
the release fence on thread 1 happens-before the acquire fence on thread 2.

A fence does not have to directly precede or follow the atomic operations.
Anything else can happen in between, including control flow.
This can be used to make the fence conditional, similar to how compare-and-exchange operations have both a success and a failure ordering.

For example, if we load a pointer from an atomic variable using acquire memory ordering,
we could use a fence to apply the acquire ordering only when the pointer is not null:

This can be beneficial if the pointer is often expected to be null, to avoid
acquire memory ordering when not necessary.

Let’s take a look at a more complicated use case of release and acquire fences:

``` rust
use std::sync::atomic::fence;

static mut DATA: [u64; 10] = [0; 10];

const ATOMIC_FALSE: AtomicBool = AtomicBool::new(false);
static READY: [AtomicBool; 10] = [ATOMIC_FALSE; 10];

fn main() {
    for i in 0..10 {
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let data = some_calculation(i);
            unsafe { DATA[i] = data };
            READY[i].store(true, Release);
        });
    }
    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(500));
    let ready: [bool; 10] = std::array::from_fn(|i| READY[i].load(Relaxed));
    if ready.contains(&true) {
        fence(Acquire);
        for i in 0..10 {
            if ready[i] {
                println!("data{i} = {}", unsafe { DATA[i] });
            }
        }
    }
}
```

<div class="admonition admonition-tip">

**Tip**

<span id="index-arrayfromfn" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-fromfnarray" class="indexterm"></span> `std::array::from_fn` is an easy way to execute something a certain number
of times and collect the results into an array.

</div>

In this example, 10 threads do some calculations and store their results in a (non-atomic) shared variable.
Each thread sets an atomic boolean to indicate that the data is ready to be read by the main thread,
using a normal release-store.
The main thread waits for half a second,
checks all 10 booleans to see which threads are done,
and prints whichever results are ready.

Instead of using 10 acquire-load operations to read the booleans, the main
thread uses relaxed operations and a single acquire fence.
It executes the fence before reading the data, but only if there is data to be read.

While in this particular example it might be completely unnecessary to put any effort into such optimization,
this pattern for saving the overhead of additional acquire operations can be important
when building highly efficient concurrent data structures.

<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering-fence" class="indexterm"></span>
A `SeqCst` fence is both a release fence and an acquire fence (just like `AcqRel`),
but also part of the single total order of sequentially consistent operations.
However, only the fence is part of the total order, but not necessarily the atomic operations before or after it.
This means that unlike a release or acquire operation,
a sequentially consistent operation cannot be split into a relaxed operation and a memory fence.

### Compiler Fences

<span id="index-compilerfence" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-fences-compilerfence" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-compilerfence" class="indexterm"></span>
In addition to a regular atomic fence, the Rust standard library also provides a *compiler fence*: `std::sync::atomic::compiler_fence`.
Its signature is identical to that of the regular `fence()` we discussed above,
but its effects are restricted to just the compiler.
Unlike a regular atomic fence, it does not prevent the processor from, for example, reordering instructions.
In the vast majority of use cases for fences, a compiler fence does not suffice.

A potential use case might arise when implementing a Unix *signal handler*, or an *interrupt* on embedded systems.
These are mechanisms that can suddenly interrupt a thread to temporarily execute an unrelated function
on the same processor core.
Because it happens on the same processor core, the usual ways in which the processor might
affect memory ordering don’t apply. (More on that in [Chapter 7](hardware.html).)
In this case, a compiler fence might suffice, potentially saving an instruction and hopefully increasing performance.

Another use case involves *process-wide memory barriers*.
This technique falls outside the scope of Rust’s memory model
and is only supported on some operating systems:
on Linux through the `membarrier` syscall, and on Windows using the `FlushProcessWriteBuffers` function.
It effectively allows a thread to forcefully inject a (sequentially consistent)
atomic fence into all concurrently running threads.
This allows us to replace two matching fences
with a lightweight compiler fence on one side
and a heavyweight process-wide barrier on the other side.
If the code on the side of the lightweight fence is executed much more often, this can improve overall performance.
(See the documentation of the `membarrier` crate on crates.io for more details and a cross-platform way to use such barriers in Rust.)

A compiler fence can also be an interesting tool for exploring the effect of the processor on memory ordering.
In ["An Experiment" in Chapter 7](hardware.html#reordering-experiment), we’ll break our code on purpose by replacing a regular fence with a compiler fence.
This will let us experience the subtle but potentially disastrous effects of the
processor when using the wrong memory ordering.

## Common Misconceptions

<span id="index-memoryordering-misconceptonsabout" class="indexterm"></span>
There are a lot of misconceptions around memory ordering.
Before we end this chapter, let’s go over the most common ones.

***Myth: I need strong memory ordering to make sure changes are "immediately" visible.***

<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-misconceptionsabout" class="indexterm"></span>
A common misunderstanding is that using a weak memory ordering like `Relaxed` means that changes to an atomic variable
might never arrive at another thread, or only after a significant delay.
The name "relaxed" might make it sound like nothing happens until something
forces some part of the hardware to wake up and do what it should’ve done instead of relaxing.

The truth is that the memory model doesn’t say anything about timing at all.
It only defines in which order certain things happen; not how long you might have to wait for them.
A hypothetical computer in which it takes years to get data from one thread to another
is quite unusable, but can perfectly satisfy the memory model.

In real life, memory ordering is about things like reordering instructions, which usually happen at nanosecond scale.
Stronger memory ordering does not make your data travel faster;
it might even slow your program down.

***Myth: Disabling optimization means I don’t need to care about memory ordering.***

Both the compiler and the processor play a role in making things happen in a different order than we might expect.
Disabling compiler optimization does not disable every possible transformation in the compiler,
and does not disable the processor features that result in instruction reordering and similar potentially problematic behavior.

***Myth: Using a processor that doesn’t reorder instructions means I don’t need to care about memory ordering.***

Some simple processors, such as those in small microcontrollers, have only one
core and only ever execute one instruction at a time, all in order.
However, while it’s true that on such devices there’s a significantly lower chance of an
incorrect memory ordering resulting in actual issues,
it’s still possible for the compiler to make invalid assumptions based on incorrect memory ordering,
breaking your code.
Besides that, it’s also important to realize that even when a processor does not execute instructions out of order,
it might still have other features that can be relevant for memory ordering.

***Myth: Relaxed operations are free.***

<span id="index-relaxedmemoryordering-misconceptionsabout-2" class="indexterm"></span>
Whether this is true depends on your definition of "free."
It’s true that `Relaxed` is the most efficient memory ordering
and that it can be significantly faster than the others.
It’s even true that on all modern platforms, relaxed load and store operations
compile down to the same processor instructions as non-atomic reads and writes.

If an atomic variable is only used by a single thread,
any difference in speed with a non-atomic variable will most likely be because of
the compiler having more freedom and being more effective at optimizing non-atomic operations.
(Compilers tend to avoid most types of optimizations for atomic variables.)

However, accessing the same memory from multiple threads is usually
significantly slower than accessing it from a single thread.
A thread that continuously writes to an atomic variable will likely
experience a noticeable slowdown when other threads start repeatedly reading the variable,
since the processor cores and their caches now have to start collaborating.

We’ll explore this effect in [Chapter 7](hardware.html).

***Myth: Sequentially consistent memory ordering is a great default and is always correct.***

<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering-misconceptionsabout" class="indexterm"></span>
Putting aside performance concerns, sequentially consistent memory ordering is
often seen as the perfect type of memory ordering to default to, because of its strong guarantees.
It’s true that *if* any other memory ordering is correct, `SeqCst` is also correct.
This might make it sound like `SeqCst` is always correct.
However, it’s entirely possible that a concurrent algorithm is simply incorrect, regardless of memory ordering.

More importantly, when reading code, `SeqCst` basically tells the reader: "this
operation depends on the total order of every single `SeqCst` operation in the program," which is an incredibly far-reaching claim.
The same code would likely be easier to review and verify if it used weaker memory ordering instead, if possible.
For example, `Release` effectively tells the reader: "this relates to an acquire operation on the same variable," which involves far fewer considerations when forming an understanding of the code.

It is advisable to see `SeqCst` as a warning sign.
Seeing it in the wild often means that either something complicated is going on,
or simply that the author did not take the time to analyze their memory ordering related assumptions,
both of which are reasons for extra scrutiny.

***Myth: Sequentially consistent memory ordering can be used for a "release-load" or an "acquire-store."***

<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering-misconceptionsabout-2" class="indexterm"></span>
While `SeqCst` can stand in for `Acquire` or `Release`,
it is not a way to somehow create an acquire-store or release-load. Those remain nonexistent.
Release only applies to store operations, and acquire only to load operations.

For example, a `Release`-store does not form any release-acquire relationship with a `SeqCst`-store.
If you need them to be part of a globally consistent order, both operations will have to use `SeqCst`.

## Summary

- There might not be a global consistent order of all atomic operations,
  as things can appear to happen in a different order from different threads.

- However, each individual atomic variable has its own *total modification order*,
  regardless of memory ordering, which all threads agree on.

- The order of operations is formally defined through *happens-before* relationships.

- Within a single thread, there is a happens-before relationship between every single operation.

- Spawning a thread happens-before everything the spawned thread does.

- Everything a thread does happens-before joining that thread.

- Unlocking a mutex happens-before locking that mutex again.

- Acquire-loading the value from a release-store establishes a happens-before relationship.
  This value may be modified by any number of fetch-and-modify and compare-and-exchange operations.

- A consume-load would be a lightweight version of an acquire-load, if it existed.

- Sequentially consistent ordering results in a globally consistent order of operations,
  but is almost never necessary and can make code review more complicated.

- Fences allow you to combine the memory ordering of multiple operations
  or apply a memory ordering conditionally.
