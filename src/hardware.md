# Chapter 7. Understanding the Processor

While the theory from Chapters [2](atomics.html) and [3](memory-ordering.html)
is all we need to write correct concurrent code,
it can additionally be very useful to develop an approximate understanding of
what goes on in practice at the processor level.
In this chapter, we’ll explore the machine instructions that
atomic operations compile down to, how different processor architectures differ,
why a weak version of `compare_exchange` exists,
what memory ordering means at the lowest level of individual instructions,
and how caching relates to it all.

The goal of this chapter is not to understand every relevant detail of every
single processor architecture.
That would take many bookshelves full of books,
many of which have probably not been written or are not publicly available.
Instead, the goal of this chapter is to develop a general idea of how
atomics work at the processor level,
to be able to make more informed decisions when implementing and optimizing
code involving atomics.
And, of course, to simply satisfy our curiosity about what goes on behind the scenes—taking a break from all the abstract theory.

To make things as concrete as possible,
we’ll focus on two specific processor architectures:
<span id="index-processorarchitecture" class="indexterm"></span>

x86-64:  
<span id="index-x86-64processorarchitecture" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-Intelprocessors" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-AMDprocessors" class="indexterm"></span>
The 64-bit version of the x86 architecture implemented by Intel and AMD processors
used in the majority of laptops, desktops, servers, and some game consoles.
While the originally 16-bit x86 architecture and its very popular 32-bit extension
were developed by Intel, the 64-bit version that we now call x86-64
was initially an extension developed by AMD, often referred to as AMD64.
Intel also developed its own 64-bit architecture, IA-64,
but ended up adopting AMD’s more popular x86 extension instead
(under the names IA-32e, EM64T, and later Intel 64).

ARM64:  
<span id="index-ARM64processorarchitecture" class="indexterm"></span>
The 64-bit version of the ARM architecture used by nearly all modern mobile devices,
high performance embedded systems,
and also increasingly in recent laptops and desktops.
It is also known as AArch64 and was introduced as part of ARMv8.
Earlier (32-bit) versions of ARM, which are similar in many ways, are used
in an even wider variety of applications.
Many popular microcontrollers in every kind of embedded system imaginable,
from cars to electronic COVID tests, are based on ARMv6 and ARMv7.

These two architectures are unalike in many ways.
Most importantly, they take different approaches to atomics.
Understanding how atomics work on both of them provides us with a
more general understanding that is transferable to many other architectures.

## Processor Instructions

We can develop an approximate understanding of how things work at the processor level by
taking a close look at the output of the compiler, the exact instructions that the processor will execute.
<span id="index-instructions" class="indexterm"></span>

### Brief Introduction to Assembly

When compiling software written in any compiled language like Rust or C,
your code gets translated into *machine instructions* that can be executed by the
processor that will eventually run your program.
These instructions are highly specific to the processor architecture
you’re compiling your program for.

<span id="index-machinecode" class="indexterm"></span>
These instructions, also called *machine code*, are encoded in binary form,
which is quite unreadable to us humans.
<span id="index-assembly" class="indexterm"></span> *Assembly* is the human-readable representation of these instructions.
Every instruction is represented by one line of text,
usually starting with a single word or acronym to identify the instruction,
followed by its arguments or operands.
<span id="index-assembler" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-disassembler" class="indexterm"></span>
An *assembler* converts the text representation to binary representation,
and a *disassembler* does the opposite.

After compiling from a language like Rust, most of the structure of the original source code is gone.
Depending on optimization level, functions and function calls might still be recognizable.
However, types such as structs or enums have been reduced to bytes and addresses,
and loops and conditionals have been reduced to a flat structure with basic jump or branch instructions.

Here’s an example of what a snippet of assembly for a small part of a program might look like,
for some made-up architecture:

``` rust
ldr x, 1234 // load from memory address 1234 into x
li y, 0     // set y to zero
inc x       // increment x
add y, x    // add x to y
mul x, 3    // multiply x by 3
cmp y, 10   // compare y to 10
jne -5      // jump five instructions back if not equal
str 1234, x // store x to memory address 1234
```

<span id="index-registers" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-processorregisters" class="indexterm"></span>
In this example, `x` and `y` are names of *registers*.
Registers are part of the processor, not of the main memory,
and usually hold a single integer or memory address.
On 64-bit architectures, they are generally 64 bits in size.
The number of registers varies per architecture,
but is usually very limited.
Registers are basically used as a temporary scratchpad in calculations, a place to keep intermediary results before storing things back to memory.

<span id="index-labelassembly" class="indexterm"></span>
Constants that refer to specific memory addresses,
such as `1234` and `-5` in the example above,
are often replaced with more human-readable *labels*.
The assembler will automatically replace them with the actual address
when converting assembly to binary machine code.

Using labels, the previous example might look like this instead:

``` rust
         ldr x, SOME_VAR
         li y, 0
my_loop: inc x
         add y, x
         mul x, 3
         cmp y, 10
         jne my_loop
         str SOME_VAR, x
```

Since the names of the labels are only part of the assembly, but not of the binary machine code,
a disassembler will not know what labels were originally used and will most likely just use meaningless generated names like `label1` and `var2`.

A full course on assembly for all the different architectures falls outside the scope of this book,
but is not a prerequisite for reading this chapter.
A very general understanding is more than enough to understand the examples,
as we’ll only be reading assembly, not writing it.
The relevant instructions in each example will be explained in enough detail to
be able to follow along with no prior experience with assembly.

<span id="index-assembly-inspectingcompileroutput" class="indexterm"></span>
To look at the exact machine code that the Rust compiler produces, we have several options.
We could compile our code as usual, and then use a disassembler (such as `objdump`)
to turn the produced binary file back into assembly.
<span id="index-disassembler-2" class="indexterm"></span>
Using the debug information the compiler produces as part of the compilation process,
the disassembler can produce labels that correspond to the original function names
of the Rust source code.
A downside of this method is that you need a disassembler that supports the specific
processor architecture you’re compiling for.
While the Rust compiler supports many architectures, many disassemblers
only support the one architecture that they were compiled for.

<span id="index---emitasmrustc" class="indexterm"></span>
A more direct option is to ask the compiler to produce assembly instead of a binary by using the `--emit=asm` flag to `rustc`.
A downside of this method is that the produced output contains a lot of irrelevant lines,
containing information for the assembler and debug tools that we don’t need.

<span id="index-cargo-show-asm" class="indexterm"></span>
There are great tools such as [`cargo-show-asm`](https://oreil.ly/ePDzj)
that integrate with `cargo` and automate the process of compiling your crate with the right flags,
finding the relevant assembly for the function you’re interested in,
and highlighting the relevant lines containing the actual instructions.

<span id="index-Godbolt" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-CompilerExplorer" class="indexterm"></span>
For relatively small snippets, the easiest and most recommended way is to use a
web service like the excellent [Compiler Explorer by Matt Godbolt](https://godbolt.org/).
This website allows you to write code in a number of languages, including Rust,
and directly see corresponding compiled assembly using the selected compiler version.
It even uses coloring to show which lines of Rust correspond to which
lines of assembly, as far as such a correspondence still exists after optimization.

Since we want to look at the assembly for different architectures,
we’ll need to specify an exact target for the Rust compiler to compile to.
We’ll use `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for x86-64 and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` for ARM64.
These are already supported directly in Compiler Explorer.
<span id="index-x86-64processorarchitecture-x8664-unknown-linux-musltarget" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64processorarchitecture-aarch64-unknown-linux-musltarget" class="indexterm"></span>
If you’re compiling locally, for example using `cargo-show-asm` or the other methods mentioned above,
you’ll need to make sure you’ve installed the Rust standard library for these targets,
which is usually done using `rustup target add`.
<span id="index-rustup" class="indexterm"></span>

In all cases, the target to compile for is selected using the `--target` compiler flag.
<span id="index---targetrustc" class="indexterm"></span>
For example, `--target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`.
If you don’t specify any target, it’ll automatically pick the platform you’re currently on.
(Or, in the case of Compiler Explorer, the platform that it is hosted on,
which is currently `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`.)

<span id="index-compileroptimization-enabling" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index---releaseflagcargo" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index--Oflagrustc" class="indexterm"></span>
In addition, it’s advisable to enable the `-O` flag to enable optimization
(or `--release` when using Cargo),
as that will enable optimization and disable overflow checking,
which can significantly reduce the amount of produced
assembly for the small functions we’ll be looking at.

To try it out, let’s look at the assembly for x86-64 and ARM64 for the following function:

``` rust
pub fn add_ten(num: &mut i32) {
    *num += 10;
}
```

Using `-O --target=aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` as the compiler flags with any of
the methods described above, we’ll get something like the following assembly output for ARM64:

``` rust
add_ten:
    ldr w8, [x0]
    add w8, w8, #10
    str w8, [x0]
    ret
```

The `x0` register contains the argument to our function, `num`, the address of the `i32` to increment by ten.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-ldrloadregister" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ldrloadregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
First, the `ldr` instruction loads the 32-bit value from that memory address into the `w8` register.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-add" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-addinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
Then, the `add` instruction adds ten to `w8` and stores the result back into `w8`.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-strstoreregister" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-strstoreregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
And afterwards, the `str` instruction stores the `w8` register back into the same memory address.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-retreturn" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-retreturninstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
Finally, the `ret` instruction marks the end of the function and causes the processor to jump back and continue with the function that called `add_ten`.

If we compile the exact same code for `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, we’ll get something like this instead:

``` rust
add_ten:
    add dword ptr [rdi], 10
    ret
```

<span id="index-x86-64instructions-add" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-addinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-retreturn" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-retreturninstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
This time, a register called `rdi` is used for the `num` argument.
More interestingly, on x86-64, a single `add` instruction can do what takes three instructions on ARM64:
loading, incrementing, and storing a value.

<span id="index-complexinstructionsetcomputerCISC" class="indexterm"></span>
This is usually the case on a *complex instruction set computer* (CISC) architecture, such as x86.
Instructions on such an architecture often have many variants,
for example to operate on a register or to directly operate on memory of certain size.
<span id="index-dword" class="indexterm"></span>
(The `dword` in the assembly specifies a 32-bit operation.)

<span id="index-reducedinstructionsetcomputerRISC" class="indexterm"></span>
In contrast, a *reduced instruction set computer* (RISC) architecture, like ARM,
usually has a simpler set of instructions with very few variants.
Most instructions can only operate on registers,
and loading and storing to memory takes a separate instruction.
This allows for a simpler processor, which can result in a reduction in cost or
sometimes higher performance.

This difference is especially relevant for atomic fetch-and-modify instructions,
as we’ll see momentarily.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

While compilers are generally pretty smart, they don’t always generate the most optimal assembly,
especially when atomic operations are involved.
If you’re experimenting and find cases where you feel confused by a seemingly needless complexity in the assembly,
that often just means there’s more optimization opportunities for a future version of the compiler.

### Load and Store

<span id="index-loadandstoreoperationsatomic-onARM64andx86-64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-instructions-loadandstoreoperations" class="indexterm"></span>
Before we dive into anything more advanced,
let’s first look at the instructions used for the most basic atomic operations: load and store.

A regular non-atomic store through a `&mut i32` takes just a single instruction
on both x86-64 and ARM64, as shown below:

<span id="index-x86-64instructions-movmove" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-movmoveinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
On x86-64, the very versatile `mov` instruction is used to copy ("move") data
from one place to another; in this case, from a zero constant to memory.
On ARM64, the `str` (store register) instruction is used to store a 32-bit register into memory.
In this case, the special `wzr` register is used, which always contains zero.

If we change the code to instead
use a relaxed atomic store to an `AtomicI32`, we get:

Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the assembly is identical to the non-atomic version.
As it turns out, the `mov` and `str` instructions were already atomic.
They either happened, or they didn’t happen at all.
Apparently, any difference between `&mut i32` and `&AtomicI32` here is only relevant
for the compiler checks and optimizations,
but is meaningless for the processor—at least for relaxed store operations on these two architectures.

The same thing happens when we look at relaxed load operations:

</figure>

On x86-64 the `mov` instruction is used again,
this time to copy from memory into the 32-bit `eax` register.
On ARM64, the `ldr` (load register) instruction is used to load the value from memory into the `w0` register.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

<span id="index-registers-returnvalue" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-processorregisters-returnvalue" class="indexterm"></span>
The 32-bit `eax` and `w0` registers are used for passing back a 32-bit return value of a function.
(For 64-bit values, the 64-bit `rax` and `x0` registers are used.)

</div>

While the processor apparently does not differentiate between atomic and non-atomic stores and loads,
we cannot safely ignore the difference in our Rust code.
If we use a `&mut i32`, the Rust compiler may assume that no other thread can concurrently
access the same `i32`, and might decide to transform or optimize the code in such a way
that a store operation no longer results in a single corresponding store instruction.
For example, it would be perfectly correct, although somewhat unusual,
for a non-atomic 32-bit load or store to happen with two separate 16-bit instructions.

### Read-Modify-Write Operations

<span id="index-instructions-read-modify-writeoperations" class="indexterm"></span>
Things get far more interesting for *read-modify-write operations* such as addition.
As discussed earlier in this chapter, a non-atomic read-modify-write operation
usually compiles to three separate instructions (read, modify, and write) on a RISC architecture like ARM64,
but can often be done in a single instruction on a CISC architecture like x86-64.
This short example demonstrates that:

Before we even look at the corresponding atomic operation,
we can reasonably assume that this time we will see a difference between the non-atomic and atomic versions.
The ARM64 version here is clearly not atomic, as loading and storing happens in separate steps.

While not directly obvious from the assembly itself, the x86-64 version is not atomic.
<span id="index-microinstructions" class="indexterm"></span>
The `add` instruction will be split by the processor into several *microinstructions* behind the scenes,
with separate steps for loading the value and storing the result.
This would be irrelevant on a single-core computer, as switching a processor
core between threads generally only happens between instructions.
However, when multiple cores are executing instructions in parallel,
we can no longer assume instructions all happen atomically without considering the
multiple steps involved in executing a single instruction.

#### x86 lock prefix

<span id="index-fetch-and-modifyoperationsatomic-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-lockprefixx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-lockprefix" class="indexterm"></span>
To support multi-core systems, Intel introduced an instruction prefix called `lock`.
It is used as a modifier to instructions like `add` to make their operation atomic.

The `lock` prefix originally caused the processor to temporarily block all other cores
from accessing memory for the duration of the instruction.
While this is a simple and effective way to make something appear as atomic
to the other cores, it can be quite inefficient to stop the world for every atomic operation.
Newer processors have a much more advanced implementation of the `lock` prefix,
which doesn’t stop other cores from operating on unrelated memory,
and allows cores to do useful things while waiting for a certain piece of memory to become available.

The `lock` prefix can only be applied to a very limited number of instructions,
including `add`, `sub`, `and`, `not`, `or`, and `xor`, which are all very
useful operations to be able to do atomically.
<span id="index-x86-64instructions-xchgexchange" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-xchgexchangeinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
The `xchg` (exchange) instruction, which corresponds to the atomic swap operation,
has an implicit lock prefix: it behaves like `lock xchg` regardless of the `lock` prefix.

Let’s see `lock add` in action by changing our last example to operate on an `AtomicI32`:

As expected, the only difference with the non-atomic version is the `lock` prefix.

In the example above, we ignore the return value from `fetch_add`, the value of `x` before the operation.
However, if we use that value, the `add` instruction no longer suffices.
The `add` instruction can provide a little bit of useful information to next instructions,
such as whether the updated value was zero or negative,
but it does not provide the full (original or updated) value.
Instead, another instruction can be used: `xadd` ("exchange and add"),
which puts the originally loaded value into a register.
<span id="index-x86-64instructions-xaddexchangeandadd" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-xaddexchangeandaddinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>

We can see it in action by making a
small modification to our code to return the value that `fetch_add` returns:

Instead of a constant 10, a register containing the value 10 is now used instead.
The `xadd` instruction will reuse that register to store the old value.

<span id="index-x86-64instructions-subsubtract" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-subsubtractinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
Unfortunately, other than `xadd` and `xchg`,
none of the other lock-prefixable instructions, like `sub`, `and`, and `or`,
have such a variant. For example, there is no `xsub` instruction.
For subtraction that’s no issue, as `xadd` can be used with a negative value.
For `and` and `or`, however, there’s no such alternative.

<span id="index-x86-64instructions-and" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-andinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-or" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-orinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-xor" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-xorinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-btsbittestandset" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-btsbittestandsetinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-btrbittestandreset" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-btrbittestandresetinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-btcbittestandcomplement" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-btcbittestandcomplementinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
For `and`, `or`, and `xor` operations that affect only a single bit,
such as `fetch_or(1)` or `fetch_and(!1)`, it’s possible to use
the `bts` (bit test and set), `btr` (bit test and reset), and `btc` (bit test and complement) instructions.
These instructions also allow a `lock` prefix, change only a single bit,
and make the previous value of that one bit available for an instruction that follows,
such as a conditional jump.

When these operations affect more than one bit, they cannot be represented by a single x86-64 instruction.
Similarly, the `fetch_max` and `fetch_min` operations also have no corresponding x86-64 instruction.
For these operations, we need a different strategy than a simple `lock` prefix.

#### x86 compare-and-exchange instruction

<span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-cmpxchgcompareandexchange" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-cmpxchgcompareandexchangeinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-instructions-compare-and-exchangeoperations" class="indexterm"></span>
In ["Compare-and-Exchange Operations" in Chapter 2](atomics.html#cas), we saw how any atomic fetch-and-modify operation can be implemented
as a compare-and-exchange loop.
This is exactly what the compiler will use for operations that
cannot be represented by a single x86-64 instruction,
since this architecture does include a (lock-prefixable) `cmpxchg` (compare and exchange) instruction.

We can see this in action by changing our last example from `fetch_add` to `fetch_or`:

<span id="index-x86-64instructions-or-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-orinstructionx86-2" class="indexterm"></span>
The first `mov` instruction loads the value from the atomic variable into the `eax` register.
The following `mov` and `or` instructions copy that value into `ecx` and apply the binary `or` operation,
such that `eax` contains the old value and `ecx` the new value.
The `cmpxchg` instruction afterwards behaves exactly like the `compare_exchange` method in Rust.
Its first argument is the memory address on which to operate (the atomic variable),
the second argument (`ecx`) is the new value, the expected value is implicitly taken from `eax`,
and the return value is implicitly stored in `eax`.
It also sets a status flag that a subsequent instruction
can use to conditionally branch based on whether the operation succeeded or not.
<span id="index-x86-64instructions-jnejumpifnotequal" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-jnejumpifnotequalinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span>
In this case, a `jne` (jump if not equal) instruction is used to jump back to the `.L1` label
to try again on failure.

Here’s what the equivalent compare-and-exchange loop looks like in Rust, just like we saw in ["Compare-and-Exchange Operations" in Chapter 2](atomics.html#cas):

``` rust
pub fn a(x: &AtomicI32) -> i32 {
    let mut current = x.load(Relaxed);
    loop {
        let new = current | 10;
        match x.compare_exchange(current, new, Relaxed, Relaxed) {
            Ok(v) => return v,
            Err(v) => current = v,
        }
    }
}
```

Compiling this code results in the exact same assembly as the `fetch_or` version.
This shows that, at least on x86-64, they are indeed equivalent in every way.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

On x86-64, there is no difference between `compare_exchange` and
`compare_exchange_weak`. Both compile down to a `lock cmpxchg` instruction.

### Load-Linked and Store-Conditional Instructions

<span id="index-instructions-load-linkedstore-conditionalLLSCinstructions" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-load-linkedstore-conditionalLLSCloop" class="indexterm"></span>
The closest thing to a compare-and-exchange loop on a RISC architecture is a *load-linked/store-conditional* (LL/SC) loop.
It involves two special instructions that come in a pair:
a load-linked instruction, which mostly behaves like a regular load instruction,
and a store-conditional instruction, which mostly behaves like a regular store instruction.
They are used in a pair, with both instructions targeting the same memory address.
The key difference to the regular load and store instructions is that the store is conditional: it refuses to store to memory if any other thread has overwritten that memory since the load-linked instruction.

These two instructions allow us to load a value from memory, modify it, and store the new value back only if
nobody has overwritten the value since we loaded it.
If that fails, we can simply retry.
Once it succeeds, we can safely pretend the whole operation was atomic, since it didn’t get disrupted.

The key to making these instructions feasible and efficient to implement is twofold:
(1) only one memory address (per core) can be tracked at a time, and (2) the store-conditional is allowed to have false negatives,
meaning that it may fail to store even though nothing has changed that particular piece of memory.

This makes it possible to be less precise when tracking changes to memory,
at the cost of perhaps a few extra cycles through an LL/SC loop.
Access to memory could be tracked not per byte, but per chunk of 64 bytes, or per kilobyte, or even the entire memory as a whole.
Less accurate memory tracking results in more unnecessary cycles through LL/SC loops, significantly reducing performance,
but also reducing implementation complexity.

Taking things to the extreme, a basic, hypothetical single-core system could use a strategy
where it does not track writes to memory at all.
Instead, it could track interrupts or context switches, the events that can cause the processor to switch to another thread.
If, in a system without any parallelism, no such event happened,
it could safely assume no other thread could have touched the memory.
If any such event happened, it could just assume the worst, refuse the store,
and hope for better luck in the next iteration of the loop.

#### ARM load-exclusive and store-exclusive

<span id="index-load-linkedstore-conditionalLLSCloop-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-fetch-and-modifyoperationsatomic-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span>
On ARM64, or at least in the first version of ARMv8, no atomic fetch-and-modify
or compare-and-exchange operation can be represented by a single instruction.
True to its RISC nature, the load and store steps are separate from the calculation and comparison.

ARM64’s load-linked and store-conditional instructions
are called `ldxr` (load exclusive register) and `stxr` (store exclusive register).
In addition, the `clrex` (clear exclusive) instruction can be used as an alternative to `stxr`
to stop tracking writes to memory without storing anything.

To see them in action, let’s see what happens when we do an atomic addition on ARM64:

We get something that looks quite similar to the non-atomic version we got before (in ["Read-Modify-Write Operations"](#rmw-ops)):
a load instruction, an add instruction, and a store instruction.
The load and store instructions have been replaced by their "exclusive" LL/SC version,
and a new `cbnz` (compare and branch on nonzero) instruction appeared.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-cbnzcompareandbranchonnonzero" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-cbnzcompareandbranchonnonzeroinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
The `stxr` instruction stores a zero in `w10` if it succeeded, or a one if it didn’t.
The `cbnz` instruction uses this to restart the whole operation if it failed.

Note that unlike with `lock add` on x86-64, we don’t need to do anything special to retrieve the old value.
In the example above, the old value will still be available in register `w8` after the operation succeeds,
so there’s no need for a specialized instruction like `xadd`.

This LL/SC pattern is quite flexible: it doesn’t just work for a limited set of operations like `add` and `or`,
but for virtually any operation.
We can just as easily implement an atomic `fetch_divide` or `fetch_shift_left` by putting the corresponding
instruction(s) between the `ldxr` and `stxr` instructions.
However, if there are too many instructions between them, there’s an increasingly high chance
of disruption resulting in extra cycles.
Generally, the compiler will attempt to keep the number of instructions in an LL/SC pattern as small as possible,
to avoid LL/SC loops that would rarely—or even never—succeed and thus could spin forever.

##### ARMv8.1 Atomic Instructions

<span id="index-ARMv81atomicinstructions" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-ARMv81atomicinstructions" class="indexterm"></span>
A later version of ARM64, part of ARMv8.1, also includes new CISC style instructions for common atomic operations.
<span id="index-ldaddloadandaddinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
For example, the new `ldadd` (load and add) instruction is equivalent to an atomic `fetch_add` operation,
without the need for an LL/SC loop.
It even includes instructions for operations like `fetch_max`, which don’t exist on x86-64.

<span id="index-cascompareandswapinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
It also includes a `cas` (compare and swap) instruction corresponding to `com⁠pare_​exchange`.
When this instruction is used, there’s no difference between `compare_exchange` and `compare_exchange_weak`,
just like on x86-64.

While the LL/SC pattern is quite flexible and nicely fits the general RISC pattern,
these new instructions can be more performant, as they can be easier to optimize for with specialized hardware.

#### Compare-and-exchange on ARM

<span id="index-instructions-compare-and-exchangeoperations-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span>
The `compare_exchange` operation maps quite nicely
onto this LL/SC pattern by using a conditional branch instruction
to skip the store instruction if the comparison failed.
Let’s look at the generated assembly:

**Note**

Note that a `compare_exchange_weak` operation is normally used in a loop

The `ldxr` instruction loads the value, which is then immediately compared with the `cmp` (compare) instruction
to the expected value of 5.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-cmpcompare" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-cmpcompareinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
The `b.ne` (branch if not equal) instruction will cause a jump to the `.L1` label if the value was not as expected,
at which point the `clrex` instruction is used to abort the LL/SC pattern.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-bnebranchifnotequal" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-bnebranchifnotequalinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
If the value was five, the flow continues through the `mov` and `stxr` instructions to store the new value of six in memory, but only if nothing has overwritten the five in the meantime.
<span id="index-ARM64instructions-movmove" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-movmoveinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>

Remember that `stxr` is allowed to have false negatives; it might fail here even if the five wasn’t overwritten.
That’s okay, because we’re using `compare_exchange_weak`, which is allowed to have false negatives too.
In fact, this is the reason why a weak version of `compare_exchange` exists.
<span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-weak-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span>

If we replace `compare_exchange_weak` with `compare_exchange`, we get
nearly identical assembly, except for an extra branch to restart the operation if it failed:

As expected, there’s now an extra `cbnz` (compare and branch on nonzero) instruction to
restart the LL/SC loop on failure.
Additionally, the `mov` instruction has been moved out of the loop, to keep the loop as short as possible.

##### Optimization of Compare-and-Exchange Loops

As we saw in ["x86 compare-and-exchange instruction"](#x86-cas), a `fetch_or` operation and the equivalent `compare_exchange` loop
compile down to the exact same instructions on x86-64.
One might expect the same to happen on ARM, at least with
`compare_exchange_weak`, as the load and weak compare-and-exchange operations
could directly be mapped to the LL/SC instructions.
<span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-compileroptimization" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-atomic-compare-and-exchangeoperations-compileroptimization" class="indexterm"></span>

Unfortunately, this is currently (as of Rust 1.66.0) not what happens.

<span id="index-compileroptimization-ofcompare-and-exchangeloops" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-load-linkedstore-conditionalLLSCloop-compileroptimization" class="indexterm"></span>
While this might change in the future as the compiler is always improving,
it’s quite hard for a compiler to safely turn a manually written compare-and-exchange loop into the corresponding LL/SC loop.
One of the reasons is that there’s a limit on the number and type of instructions that can
be put between the `stxr` and `ldxr` instructions, which is not something that
the compiler is designed to keep in mind while applying other optimizations.
At the time where patterns like a compare-and-exchange loop are still recognizable,
the exact instructions that an expression will compile down to are not known yet,
making this a very tricky optimization to implement for the general case.

So, at least until we get even smarter compilers, it’s advisable to use the dedicated fetch-and-modify methods rather than a compare-and-exchange loop,
if possible.

## Caching

<span id="index-cachingprocessors" class="indexterm"></span>
Reading and writing memory is slow, and can easily cost as much time as executing tens or hundreds of instructions.
This is why all performant processors implement *caching*, to avoid interacting
with the relatively slow memory as much as possible.
The exact implementation details of memory caches in modern processors are complex, partially proprietary,
and, most importantly, mostly irrelevant to us when writing software.
After all, the name *cache* comes from the French word *caché*, meaning *hidden*.
Nevertheless, understanding the basic principles behind how most processors implement caching
can be extremely useful when optimizing software for performance.
(Not that we need an excuse to learn more about an interesting topic, of course.)

Except for very small microcontrollers, virtually all modern processors use caching.
Such a processor never interacts directly with main memory,
but instead routes every single read and write request through its cache.
If an instruction needs to read something from memory,
the processor will ask its cache for that data.
If it is already cached, the cache will quickly respond with the cached data, avoiding interacting with main memory.
Otherwise, it’ll have to take the slow path, where the cache might have to ask the main memory for a copy of the relevant data.
Once the main memory responds, not only will the cache finally respond to the original read request,
but it will also remember the data, such that it can respond more quickly the next time this data is requested.
If the cache becomes full, it makes space by dropping some old data it deems least likely to be useful.

When an instruction wants to write something to memory,
the cache could decide to hold on to the modified data without writing it to main memory.
Any subsequent read requests for the same memory address will then get a copy of the modified data,
ignoring the outdated data in main memory.
It would only actually write the data back to main memory
when the modified data needs to be dropped from the cache to make space.

In most processor architectures, the cache reads and writes memory in blocks of 64 bytes,
even if only a single byte was requested.
<span id="index-cachelines" class="indexterm"></span>
These blocks are often called *cache lines*.
By caching the entire 64-byte block that surrounds the requested byte,
any subsequent instructions that need to access any of the other bytes in that block will not have to wait for main memory.

### Cache Coherence

<span id="index-cachecoherence" class="indexterm"></span>
In modern processors, there is usually more than one layer of caching.
<span id="index-L1L2L3L4cache" class="indexterm"></span>
The first cache, or *level one (L1) cache* is the smallest and fastest.
Instead of talking to the main memory, it talks to the level two (L2) cache,
which is much larger, but slower.
The L2 cache might be the one to talk to main memory, or there might be yet another, larger and slower, L3 cache—perhaps even an L4 cache.

<span id="index-cachingprocessors-percore" class="indexterm"></span>
Adding extra layers doesn’t change much about how they work; each layer can operate independently.
Where things get interesting, however, is when there are multiple processor cores that each have their own cache.
In a multi-core system, each processor core usually has its own L1 cache, while
the L2 or L3 caches are often shared with some or all of the other cores.

A naive caching implementation would break down under these conditions,
as the cache can no longer assume it controls all interactions with the next layer.
If one cache would accept a write and mark some cache line as modified without informing the other caches,
the state of the caches could become inconsistent.
Not only would the modified data not be available to the other cores
until the cache writes the data down to the next level(s),
it could end up conflicting with different modifications cached in other caches.

<span id="index-cachecoherence-protocol" class="indexterm"></span>
To solve this problem, a *cache coherence protocol* is used.
Such a protocol defines how exactly the caches operate and communicate with each other
to keep everything in a consistent state.
The exact protocol used varies per architecture, processor model, and even per cache level.

We’ll discuss two basic cache coherence protocols. Modern processors use many variations of these.

#### The write-through protocol

<span id="index-cachecoherence-protocol-write-through" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-write-throughcachecoherenceprotocol" class="indexterm"></span>
In caches that implement the *write-through cache coherence protocol*,
writes are not cached but immediately sent through to the next layer.
The other caches are connected to the next layer through the same shared communication channel,
which means that they can observe the other caches' communications to the next layer.
When a cache observes a write for an address it currently has cached,
it immediately either drops or updates its own cache line to keep everything consistent.

Using this protocol, caches never contain any cache lines in a modified state. While this simplifies things significantly, it nullifies any benefits of caching for writes.
When optimizing just for reading, this can be a great choice.

#### The MESI protocol

<span id="index-cachecoherence-protocol-MESI" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-MESIcachecoherenceprotocol" class="indexterm"></span>
The *MESI cache coherence protocol* is named after the four possible states it defines for a cache line:
modified, exclusive, shared and invalid.
Modified (M) is used for cache lines that contain data that has been modified but not yet written
to memory (or the next level cache).
Exclusive (E) is used for cache lines that contain unmodified data that’s not cached in any other cache (at the same level).
Shared (S) is used for unmodified cache lines that might also appear in one or more of the other (same level) caches.
Invalid (I) is used for unused (empty or dropped) cache lines, which do not contain any useful data.

Caches that use this protocol communicate with all the other caches at the same level.
They send each other updates and requests to make it possible for them to stay consistent with each other.

<span id="index-cachemiss" class="indexterm"></span>
When a cache gets a request for an address it has not yet cached, also called a *cache miss*,
it does not immediately request it from the next layer.
Instead, it first asks the other caches (at the same level) if any of them have this cache line available.
If none of them have it, the cache will continue to request the address from the (slower) next layer,
and mark the resulting new cache line as exclusive (E).
When this cache line is then modified by a write operation, the cache can change the state to modified (M)
without informing the others, since it knows none of the others have the same cache line cached.

When requesting a cache line that’s already available in any of the other caches,
the result is a shared (S) cache line, obtained directly from the other cache(s).
If the cache line was in the modified (M) state, it’ll first be written (or *flushed*) to the next layer,
before changing it to shared (S) and sharing it.
If it was in the exclusive (E) state, it’ll be changed to shared (S) immediately.

If the cache wants exclusive rather than shared access
(for example, because it is going to modify the data right after),
the other cache(s) will not keep the cache line in shared (S) state,
but instead drop it entirely by changing it to invalid (I).
In this case, the result is an exclusive (E) cache line.

If a cache needs exclusive access to a cache line it already has available in the shared (S) state,
it simply tells the others to drop the cache line before upgrading it to exclusive (E).

<span id="index-cachecoherence-protocol-MOESI" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-MOESIcachecoherenceprotocol" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-cachecoherence-protocol-MESIF" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-MESIFcachecoherenceprotocol" class="indexterm"></span>
There are several variations of this protocol.
For example, the *MOESI* protocol adds an extra state to allow sharing
of modified data without immediately writing it to the next layer,
and the *MESIF* protocol uses an extra state to decide which cache responds to a
request for a shared cache line that’s available in multiple caches.
Modern processors often use more elaborate and proprietary cache coherence protocols.

### Impact on Performance

<span id="index-cachingprocessors-performanceexperiment" class="indexterm"></span>
While caching is mostly hidden from us, caching behavior can have significant
effects on the performance of our atomic operations.
Let’s try to measure some of those effects.

<span id="index-benchmarking" class="indexterm"></span>
Measuring the speed of a single atomic operation is very tricky, since they are extremely fast.
To be able to get some useful numbers, we’ll have to repeat an operation, say, a billion times,
and measure how long that takes in total.
For example, we could try to measure the time it takes for a billion load operations like this:

``` rust
static A: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

fn main() {
    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        A.load(Relaxed);
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

Unfortunately, this does not work as expected.

<span id="index-compileroptimization-enabling-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index---releaseflagcargo-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index--Oflagrustc-2" class="indexterm"></span>
When running this with optimizations turned on (e.g., with `cargo run --release` or `rustc -O`),
we’ll see an unreasonably low measured time.
What happened is that the compiler was smart enough to understand that we’re not using the loaded values,
so it decided to completely optimize the "unnecessary" loop away.

<span id="index-hintblackbox" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-blackbox" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compileroptimization-blackboxavoidingwith" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-benchmarking-blackboxavoidingoptimizationswith" class="indexterm"></span>
To avoid this, we can use the special `std::hint::black_box` function.
This function takes an argument of any type, which it just returns without doing anything.
What makes this function special is that the compiler will try its best not to assume anything
about what the function does; it treats it like a "black box" that could do anything.

We can use this to avoid certain optimizations that would render a benchmark useless.
In this case, we can pass the result of the load operation to `black_box()` to
stop any optimizations that assume we don’t actually need the loaded values.
That’s not enough, though, since the compiler could still assume that `A` is always zero,
making the load operations unnecessary.
To avoid that, we can pass a reference to `A` to `black_box()` at the start,
such that the compiler may no longer assume there’s only one thread that accesses `A`.
After all, it must assume that `black_box(&A)` might have spawned an extra thread that interacts with `A`.

Let’s try that out:

``` rust
use std::hint::black_box;

static A: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

fn main() {
    black_box(&A); // New!
    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        black_box(A.load(Relaxed)); // New!
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

The output fluctuates a bit when running this multiple times,
but on a not-so-recent x86-64 computer, it seems to give a result of about 300 milliseconds.

To see any caching effects, we’ll spawn a background thread that interacts with the atomic variable.
That way, we can see if it affects the load operations of the main thread or not.

First, let’s try that with just load operations on the background thread, as follows:

``` rust
static A: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

fn main() {
    black_box(&A);

    thread::spawn(|| { // New!
        loop {
            black_box(A.load(Relaxed));
        }
    });

    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        black_box(A.load(Relaxed));
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

Note that we’re not measuring the performance of the operations on the background thread.
We’re still only measuring how long it takes for the main thread to perform a billion load operations.

Running this program results in similar measurements as before: it fluctuates a bit around 300 milliseconds
when tested on the same x86-64 computer.
The background thread has no significant effect on the main thread.
They presumably each run on a separate processor core, but the caches of *both* cores
contain a copy of `A`, allowing for very fast access.

Now let’s change the background thread to perform store operations instead:

``` rust
static A: AtomicU64 = AtomicU64::new(0);

fn main() {
    black_box(&A);
    thread::spawn(|| {
        loop {
            A.store(0, Relaxed); // New!
        }
    });
    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        black_box(A.load(Relaxed));
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

This time, we do see a significant difference.
Running this program on the same x86-64 machine now results in an output that fluctuates around
three whole seconds, almost ten times as much as before.
More recent computers will show a less significant but still very measurable difference.
For example, it went from 350 milliseconds to 500 milliseconds on a recent Apple M1 processor,
and from 250 milliseconds to 650 milliseconds on a very recent x86-64 AMD processor.

This behavior matches our understanding of cache coherence protocols:
a store operation requires exclusive access to a cache line, which slows down
subsequent load operations on other cores that no longer share the cache line.

#### Failing Compare-and-Exchange Operations

<span id="index-cachingprocessors-compare-and-exchangeoperationseffectof" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-compare-and-exchangeoperationsatomic-cachingeffecton" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-atomic-compare-and-exchangeoperations-cachingeffecton" class="indexterm"></span>
Interestingly, on most processor architectures, the same effect we saw with store operations also happens
when the background thread performs only compare-and-exchange operations, even if they all fail.

To try that out, we can replace the store operation (of the background thread) with a call to `compare_exchange`
that will never succeed:

``` rust
    …
        loop {
            // Never succeeds, because A is never 10.
            black_box(A.compare_exchange(10, 20, Relaxed, Relaxed).is_ok());
        }
    …
```

Because `A` is always zero, this `compare_exchange` operation will never succeed.
It’ll load the current value of `A`, but never update it to a new value.

One might reasonably expect this to behave the same as a load operation, since
it does not modify the atomic variable.
However, on most processor architectures, the instruction(s) of `compare_exchange` will claim
exclusive access of the relevant cache line regardless of whether the comparison succeeds or not.

<span id="index-spinlocks-compare-and-exchangenotusing" class="indexterm"></span>
This means that it can be beneficial to not use `compare_exchange` (or `swap`) in a spin loop
like we did for our `SpinLock` in [Chapter 4](building-spinlock.html), but instead use a `load` operation
first to check if the lock has been unlocked.
That way, we avoid unnecessarily claiming exclusive access to the relevant cache line.

<span id="index-cachelines-performanceexperiment" class="indexterm"></span>
Since caching happens per cache line, not per individual byte or variable,
we should be able to see the same effect using adjacent variables rather than the same one.
To try this out, let’s use three atomic variables instead of one,
have the main thread use only the middle variable, and make the background thread use only the other two, as follows:

``` rust
static A: [AtomicU64; 3] = [
    AtomicU64::new(0),
    AtomicU64::new(0),
    AtomicU64::new(0),
];

fn main() {
    black_box(&A);
    thread::spawn(|| {
        loop {
            A[0].store(0, Relaxed);
            A[2].store(0, Relaxed);
        }
    });
    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        black_box(A[1].load(Relaxed));
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

Running this produces similar results as before: it takes several seconds on that same x86-64 computer.
Even though `A[0]`, `A[1]`, and `A[2]` are each used by only one thread,
we still see the same effects as if we’re using the same variable on both threads.
The reason is that `A[1]` shares a cache line with either or both of the others.
The processor core running the background thread repeatedly claims exclusive access
to the cache line(s) containing `A[0]` and `A[2]`, which also contains `A[1]`,
slowing down "unrelated" operations on `A[1]`.
<span id="index-falsesharing" class="indexterm"></span>
This effect is called *false sharing*.

We can avoid this by spacing the atomic variables further apart, so they each get their own cache line.
As mentioned before, 64 bytes is a reasonable guess for the size of a cache line,
so let’s try wrapping our atomics in a 64-byte aligned struct, as follows:

``` rust
#[repr(align(64))] // This struct must be 64-byte aligned.
struct Aligned(AtomicU64);

static A: [Aligned; 3] = [
    Aligned(AtomicU64::new(0)),
    Aligned(AtomicU64::new(0)),
    Aligned(AtomicU64::new(0)),
];

fn main() {
    black_box(&A);
    thread::spawn(|| {
        loop {
            A[0].0.store(1, Relaxed);
            A[2].0.store(1, Relaxed);
        }
    });
    let start = Instant::now();
    for _ in 0..1_000_000_000 {
        black_box(A[1].0.load(Relaxed));
    }
    println!("{:?}", start.elapsed());
}
```

<span id="index-repralign" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-alignment" class="indexterm"></span>
The `#[repr(align)]` attribute enables us to tell the compiler
the (minimal) alignment of our type, in bytes.
Since an `AtomicU64` is only 8 bytes, this will add 56 bytes of padding to our `Aligned` struct.

Running this program no longer gives slow results.
Instead, we get the same results as when we had no background thread at all:
about 300 milliseconds when run on the same x86-64 computer as before.

<div class="admonition admonition-tip">

**Tip**

Depending on the type of processor you’re trying this on, you might need
to use 128-byte alignment to see the same effect.

</div>

The experiment above shows that it can be advisable not to
put unrelated atomic variables close to each other.
For example, a dense array of small mutexes might not always perform as well as
an alternative structure that keeps the mutexes spaced further apart.

On the other hand, when multiple (atomic) variables are related and often accessed in quick succession,
it can be good to put them close together.
<span id="index-spinlocks-cachelineseffectof" class="indexterm"></span>
For example, our `SpinLock<T>` from [Chapter 4](building-spinlock.html) stores the `T` right next to the `AtomicBool`,
which means it’s likely that the cache line containing the `AtomicBool` will also contain the `T`,
such that a claim for (exclusive) access to one also includes the other.
Whether this is beneficial depends entirely on the situation.

## Reordering

<span id="index-reorderinginstructions-2" class="indexterm"></span>
Consistent caching, for example through the MESI protocol we explored earlier in this chapter,
generally does not affect correctness of a program, even when multiple threads are involved.
The only observable differences caused by consistent caching come down to differences in timing.
However, modern processors implement many more optimizations that can have a big impact on correctness,
at least when multiple threads are involved.

At the start of [Chapter 3](memory-ordering.html), we briefly discussed *instruction reordering*,
how both the compiler and the processor can change the order of instructions.
Focusing just on the processor, here are some examples of various ways in which instructions, or their effects,
might happen *out of order*:

Store buffers  
Since writes can be slow, even with caching, processor cores often include a *store buffer*.
<span id="index-storebuffers" class="indexterm"></span>
Write operations to memory can be stored in this store buffer, which is very quick, to allow the processor
to immediately continue with the instructions that follow.
Then, in the background, the write operation is completed by writing to the (L1) cache,
which can be significantly slower.
This way, the processor does not have to wait while the cache coherence protocol jumps into action
to get exclusive access to the relevant cache line.

As long as special care is taken to handle subsequent read operations from the same memory address,
this is entirely invisible for instructions running as part of the same thread, on the same processor core.
However, for a brief moment, the write operation is not yet visible to the other cores,
resulting in an inconsistent view of what the memory looks like from different threads running on different cores.

Invalidation queues  
Regardless of the exact coherency protocol, caches that operate in parallel need to process invalidation requests:
instructions to drop a specific cache line because it’s about to be modified and become invalid.
<span id="index-invalidationqueues" class="indexterm"></span>
As a performance optimization, it’s common for such requests not to be
processed immediately, but to be queued for (slightly) later processing instead.
When such invalidation queues are in use, the caches are no longer always consistent,
as cache lines might be briefly outdated before they are dropped.
However, this has no impact on a single threaded program, other than speeding it up.
The only impact is the visibility of write operations from other cores,
which might now appear as (very slightly) delayed.

Pipelining  
<span id="index-pipelining" class="indexterm"></span>
Another very common processor feature that significantly improves performance is *pipelining*:
executing consecutive instructions in parallel, if possible.
Before an instruction finishes executing,
the processor might already start executing the next one.
Modern processors can often start the execution of quite a few instructions in
series while the first one is still in progress.

If each instruction operates on the result from the previous one, this doesn’t help much;
they each still need to wait on the result of the one before it.
But when an instruction can be executed independently of the previous one, it might even finish first.
For example, an instruction that just increments a register might finish very quickly,
while a previously started instruction might still be waiting on reading something from memory,
or some other slow operation.

While this doesn’t affect a single threaded program (other than speed),
interaction with other cores might happen out of order when an instruction that operates on memory
finishes executing before a preceding one does.

There are many ways in which a modern processor might end up executing
instructions in an entirely different order than expected.
There are many proprietary techniques involved,
some of which become public only when a subtle mistake is found that can be exploited by malicious software.
When they work as expected, however, they all have one thing in common:
they do not affect single threaded programs, other than timing, but can cause interaction with
other cores to appear to happen in an inconsistent order.

Processor architectures that allow for memory operations to be reordered
also provide a way to prevent this through special instructions.
These instructions might, for example, force the processor to flush its store buffer,
or to finish any pipelined instructions, before continuing.
Sometimes, these instructions only prevent a certain type of reordering.
For example, there might be an instruction to prevent store operations from
being reordered with respect to each other,
while still allowing load operations to be reordered.
Which types of reordering might happen, and how they can be prevented, depends on the processor architecture.

## Memory Ordering

<span id="index-instructions-memoryordering" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-atprocessorlevel" class="indexterm"></span>
When performing any atomic operation in a language like Rust or C, we specify a memory ordering
to inform the compiler of our ordering requirements.
The compiler will generate the right instructions for the processor to prevent it from
reordering instructions in ways that would break the rules.

<span id="index-reorderinginstructions-memoryordering" class="indexterm"></span>
Which types of instruction reordering are allowed depends on the kind of memory operation.
For non-atomic and relaxed atomic operations, any type of reordering is acceptable.
At the other extreme, sequentially consistent atomic operations don’t allow for any type of reordering at all.

An acquire operation may not get reordered with any memory operations that follow,
while a release operation may not be reordered with any memory operations that precede it.
Otherwise, some mutex-protected data might be accessed before acquiring—​or after releasing—​its mutex, resulting in a data race.

### Other-Multi-Copy Atomicity

<span id="index-multi-copyatomicity" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-other-multi-copyatomicity" class="indexterm"></span>
The ways in which the order of memory operations is affected on some processor architectures,
such as those one might find in graphics cards,
cannot always be explained by instruction reordering.
The effect of two consecutive store operations on one core
might become visible in the same order on a second core,
but in opposite order on a third core.
This could happen, for example, because of inconsistent caching or shared store buffers.
This effect can’t be explained by the instructions on the first core being reordered,
as that doesn’t explain the inconsistency between the second and third core’s observations.

The theoretical memory model we discussed in [Chapter 3](memory-ordering.html) leaves space for such processor architectures by not requiring a globally consistent order for anything but sequentially consistent atomic operations.
<span id="index-x86-64processorarchitecture-other-multi-copyatomic" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64processorarchitecture-other-multi-copyatomic" class="indexterm"></span>

The architectures we’re focusing on in this chapter, x86-64 and ARM64, are *other-multi-copy atomic*, which means that write operations, once they are visible to any core, become visible to all cores at the same time.
For other-multi-copy atomic architectures, memory ordering is only a matter of instruction reordering.

Some architectures, such as ARM64, are called *weakly ordered*,
as they allow the processor to freely reorder any memory operation.
On the other hand, *strongly ordered* architectures, such as x86-64, are very
restrictive about which memory operations may be reordered.

### x86-64: Strongly Ordered

<span id="index-x86-64processorarchitecture-stronglyordered" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span>
On an x86-64 processor, a load operation will never appear to have happened after a memory operation that follows.
Similarly, this architecture doesn’t allow for a store operation to appear to have happened before a preceding
memory operation.
The only kind of reordering you might see on x86-64
is a store operation getting delayed until after a later load operation.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

<span id="index-processorarchitecture-stronglyordered" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-stronglyorderedarchitecture" class="indexterm"></span>
Because of the reordering restrictions of the x86-64 architecture,
it is often described as a *strongly ordered* architecture,
although some prefer to reserve this term for architectures that preserve the order of *all* memory operations.

</div>

These restrictions satisfy all the needs of acquire-loads (because a load is never reordered with a later operation),
and of release-stores (because a store is never reordered with an earlier operation).
<span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span>
This means that on x86-64, we get release and acquire semantics "for free":
release and acquire operations are identical to relaxed operations.

We can verify this by seeing what happens to a few of the snippets from ["Load and Store"](#load-store-ops) and ["x86 lock prefix"](#lock-prefix)
when we change `Relaxed` to `Release`, `Acquire`, or `AcqRel`:

As expected, the assembly is identical, even though we specified a stronger memory ordering.

We can conclude that on x86-64, ignoring potential compiler optimizations,
acquire and release operations are just as cheap as relaxed operations.
Or, perhaps more accurately, that relaxed operations are just as expensive as acquire and release operations.

Let’s check out what happens for `SeqCst`:

The `load` and `fetch_add` operations still result in the same assembly as before,
but assembly for `store` changed completely.
The `xor` instruction looks a bit out of place, but is just a common way to set the `eax` register to zero
by `xor`'ing it with itself, which always results in zero.
A `mov eax, 0` instruction would’ve worked as well, but takes a bit more space.

The interesting part is the `xchg` instruction, which is normally used for a swap operation:
a store operation that also retrieves the old value.
<span id="index-x86-64instructions-xchgexchange-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-xchgexchangeinstructionx86-2" class="indexterm"></span>

A regular `mov` instruction like before wouldn’t suffice for a `SeqCst` store, because it would allow reordering it with a later load operation, breaking the globally consistent order.
By changing it to an operation that also performs a load, even though we don’t care about the value it loads,
we get the additional guarantee of our instruction not getting reordered with later memory operations,
solving the issue.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

A `SeqCst` load operation can still be a regular `mov`, exactly because `SeqCst` stores are upgraded to `xchg`.
`SeqCst` operations guarantee a globally consistent order only with other `SeqCst` operations.
The `mov` from a `SeqCst` load might still be reordered with the `mov` of an earlier non-`SeqCst` store operation,
but that’s perfectly fine.

</div>

<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span>
On x86-64, a store operation is the only atomic operation for which there’s a difference between `SeqCst` and
weaker memory ordering.
In other words, x86-64 `SeqCst` operations other than stores are just as cheap
as `Release`, `Acquire`, `AcqRel`, and even `Relaxed` operations.
Or, if you prefer, x86-64 makes `Relaxed` operations other than stores as
expensive as `SeqCst` operations.

### ARM64: Weakly Ordered

<span id="index-ARM64processorarchitecture-weaklyordered" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-processorarchitecture-weaklyordered" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-weaklyorderedarchitecture" class="indexterm"></span>
On a *weakly ordered* architecture such as ARM64,
all memory operations can potentially be reordered with each other.
This means that unlike x86-64, acquire and release operations will not be identical to relaxed operations.
<span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span>

Let’s take a look at what happens on ARM64 for `Release`, `Acquire`, and `AcqRel`:

The changes, compared to the `Relaxed` versions we saw earlier, are very subtle:

<span class="callout">1</span> `str` (store register) is now `stlr` (store-release register).
<span id="index-stlrstore-releaseregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-stlrstore-releaseregister" class="indexterm"></span>

<span class="callout">2</span> `ldr` (load register) is now `ldar` (load-acquire register).
<span id="index-ldarload-acquireregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-ldarload-acquireregister" class="indexterm"></span>

<span class="callout">3</span> `ldxr` (load exclusive register) is now `ldaxr` (load-acquire exclusive register).
<span id="index-ldaxrload-acquireexclusiveregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-ldaxrload-acquireexclusiveregister" class="indexterm"></span>

<span class="callout">4</span> `stxr` (store exclusive register) is now `stlxr` (store-release exclusive register).
<span id="index-stlxrstore-releaseexclusiveregisterinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-stlxrstore-releaseexclusiveregister" class="indexterm"></span>

As this shows, ARM64 has special versions of its load and store instructions for acquire and release ordering.
Unlike an `ldr` or `ldxr` instruction, an `ldar` or `ldaxr` instruction will
never be reordered with any later memory operation.
Similarly, unlike an `str` or `stxr` instruction, an `stlr` or `stlxr`
instruction will never be reordered with any earlier memory operation.

<div class="admonition admonition-note">

**Note**

A fetch-and-modify operation using only `Release` or `Acquire` ordering instead of `AcqRel`
uses only one of the `stlxr` and `ldaxr` instructions, respectively,
paired with a regular `ldxr` or `stxr` instruction.

</div>

In addition to the restrictions required for release and acquire semantics,
none of the special acquire and release instructions is ever reordered
with any other of these special instructions, making them also suitable for `SeqCst`.
<span id="index-sequentiallyconsistentmemoryordering-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span>

As demonstrated below, upgrading to `SeqCst` results in the exact same assembly as before:

This means that on ARM64, sequentially consistent operations are exactly as cheap as acquire and release operations.
Or, rather, that ARM64 `Acquire`, `Release`, and `AcqRel` operations are as expensive as `SeqCst`.
Unlike x86-64, however, `Relaxed` operations are relatively cheap, as they don’t result in
stronger ordering guarantees than necessary.

#### ARMv8.1 Atomic Release and Acquire Instructions

<span id="index-ARMv81atomicinstructions-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-ARMv81atomicinstructions-2" class="indexterm"></span>
As discussed in ["ARMv8.1 Atomic Instructions"](#armv81), the ARMv8.1 version of ARM64 includes CISC style instructions for atomic operations such as `ldadd` (load and add) as an alternative to an `ldxr`/`stxr` loop.

Just like the load and store operations have special versions with acquire and release semantics, these instructions also have variants for stronger memory ordering. Because these instructions involve both a load and a store, they each have three additional variants: one for release (`-l`), one for acquire (`-a`), and one for combined release and acquire (`-al`) semantics.

<span id="index-ldaddlloadandaddreleaseinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ldaddaloadandaddacquireinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ldaddalloadandaddacquireandreleaseinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
For example, for `ldadd`, there is also `ldaddl`, `ldadda`, and `ldaddal`.
<span id="index-caslcompareandswapreleaseinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-casacompareandswapacquireinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-casalcompareandswapacquireandreleaseinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span>
Similarly, the `cas` instruction comes with the `casl`, `casa`, and `casal` variants.

Just like for the load and store instructions, the combined release and acquire (`-al`) variants also suffice for `SeqCst` operations.

### An Experiment

<span id="index-weaklyorderedarchitecture-experimentusingrelaxedinsteadofreleaseandacquire" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-experimentusingrelaxedinsteadofreleaseandacquire" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-releaseandacquirememoryordering-experimentusingrelaxedinstead" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-spinlocks-experimentusingwrongmemoryordering" class="indexterm"></span>
An unfortunate consequence of the popularity of strongly ordered architectures is that certain classes of memory ordering bugs can easily stay undiscovered.
Using `Relaxed` where `Acquire` or `Release` is necessary is incorrect,
but could accidentally end up working just fine in practice on x86-64,
assuming the compiler doesn’t reorder your atomic operations.

<div class="admonition admonition-caution">

**Caution**

Remember that it’s not only the processor that can cause things to happen out of order.
The compiler is also allowed to reorder the instructions it produces, as long as it takes
the memory ordering constraints into account.

In practice, compilers tend to be very conservative about optimizations involving atomic operations,
but that might very well change in the future.

</div>

This means one can easily write incorrect concurrent code that (accidentally) works perfectly fine on x86-64,
but might break down when compiled for and run on an ARM64 processor.

Let’s try to do exactly that.

We’ll create a spin lock–protected counter, but change all the memory orderings to `Relaxed`.
Let’s not bother with creating a custom type or unsafe code. Instead, let’s just use an `AtomicBool` for the lock and an `AtomicUsize` for the counter.

<span id="index-compilerfence-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-fences-compilerfence-2" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-memoryordering-compilerfence-2" class="indexterm"></span>
To be sure the compiler won’t be the one to reorder our operations,
we’ll use the `std::sync::atomic::compiler_fence()` function to inform the compiler
of the operations that should have been `Acquire` or `Release`,
without telling the processor.

We’ll make four threads repeatedly lock, increment the counter, and unlock—a million times each. Putting that all together, we end up with the following code:

``` rust
fn main() {
    let locked = AtomicBool::new(false);
    let counter = AtomicUsize::new(0);

    thread::scope(|s| {
        // Spawn four threads, that each iterate a million times.
        for _ in 0..4 {
            s.spawn(|| for _ in 0..1_000_000 {
                // Acquire the lock, using the wrong memory ordering.
                while locked.swap(true, Relaxed) {}
                compiler_fence(Acquire);

                // Non-atomically increment the counter, while holding the lock.
                let old = counter.load(Relaxed);
                let new = old + 1;
                counter.store(new, Relaxed);

                // Release the lock, using the wrong memory ordering.
                compiler_fence(Release);
                locked.store(false, Relaxed);
            });
        }
    });

    println!("{}", counter.into_inner());
}
```

If the lock works properly, we’d expect the final value of the counter to be exactly four million.
Note how incrementing the counter happens in a non-atomic way, with a separate `load` and `store`
rather than a single `fetch_add`, to make sure that any problems with the spin lock
could result in missed increments and thus a lower total value of the counter.

Running this program a few times on a computer with an x86-64 processor gives:

``` rust
4000000
4000000
4000000
```

As expected, we get release and acquire semantics for "free," and our mistake does not cause any issues.

Trying this on an Android phone from 2021 and a Raspberry Pi 3 model B, which both use an ARM64 processor,
results in the same output:

``` rust
4000000
4000000
4000000
```

This suggests that not all ARM64 processors make use of all forms of their instruction reordering,
although we can’t assume much based on this experiment.

When trying this out on an 2021 Apple iMac, which contains an ARM64-based Apple M1 processor, we get something different:

``` rust
3988255
3982153
3984205
```

Our previously hidden mistake suddenly turned into an actual issue—an issue that is only visible on a weakly ordered system.
The counter is only off by about 0.4%, showing how subtle such an issue can be.
In a real-life scenario, an issue like this might stay undiscovered for a very long time.

<div class="admonition admonition-tip">

**Tip**

Don’t forget to enable optimization (with `cargo run --release` or `rustc -O`) when trying to replicate the results above.
Without optimization, the same code often results in many more instructions,
which can hide the subtle effects of instruction reordering.

</div>

### Memory Fences

<span id="index-fences-instructions" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-instructions-fences" class="indexterm"></span>
There is one type of memory ordering related instruction we haven’t seen yet: memory fences.
A *memory fence* or *memory barrier* instruction is used to represent a `std::sync::atomic::fence`,
which we discussed in ["Fences" in Chapter 3](memory-ordering.html#fences).

As we’ve seen before, memory ordering on x86-64 and ARM64 is all about instruction reordering.
A fence instruction prevents certain types of instructions from being reordered past it.

An acquire fence must prevent preceding load operations from getting reordered
with any memory operations that follow.
Similarly, a release fence must prevent subsequent store operations from getting
reordered with any preceding memory operations.
A sequentially consistent fence must prevent all memory operations that precede it from being reordered
with memory operations after the fence.

On x86-64, the basic memory ordering semantics already satisfy the needs of acquire and release fences.
This architecture doesn’t allow the types of reordering that these fences prevent, regardless.

Let’s dive right in and see what instructions the four different fences compile to on both x86-64 and ARM64:

<span id="index-fences-onx86-64" class="indexterm"></span>
Unsurprisingly, release and acquire fences on x86-64 do not result in any instruction.
We get release and acquire semantics "for free" on this architecture.
<span id="index-mfencememoryfenceinstructionx86" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-x86-64instructions-mfencememoryfence" class="indexterm"></span>
Only a `SeqCst` fence results in an `mfence` (memory fence) instruction.
This instruction makes sure that all memory operations before it have been completed before continuing.

<span id="index-fences-onARM64" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-dmbdatamemorybarrierinstructionARM" class="indexterm"></span> <span id="index-ARM64instructions-dmbdatamemorybarrier" class="indexterm"></span>
On ARM64, the equivalent instruction is `dmb ish` (data memory barrier, inner shared domain).
Unlike on x86-64, it is used for `Release` and `AcqRel` as well, since this architecture doesn’t implicitly
provide acquire and release semantics.
For `Acquire`, a slightly less impactful variant is used: `dmb ishld`.
This variant only waits for load operations to complete, but freely allows
preceding store operations to be reordered past it.

Similar to what we saw before with the atomic operations,
we see that x86-64 gives us release and acquire fences "for free," while on ARM64, sequentially consistent fences come at the same cost as release fences.

## Summary

- On x86-64 and ARM64, relaxed load and store operations are identical to their non-atomic equivalents.

- The common atomic fetch-and-modify and compare-and-exchange operations
  on x86-64 (and ARM64 since ARMv8.1) have their own instructions.

- On x86-64, an atomic operation for which there is no equivalent instruction compiles down to
  a compare-and-exchange loop.

- On ARM64, any atomic operation can be represented by a load-linked/store-conditional loop:
  a loop that automatically restarts if the attempted memory operation was disrupted.

- Caches operate on cache lines, which are often 64 bytes in size.

- Caches are kept consistent with a cache coherence protocol, such as write-through or MESI.

- Padding, for example through `#[repr(align(64)]`, can be useful
  for improving performance by preventing *false sharing*.

- A load operation can be significantly cheaper than a failed compare-and-exchange operation,
  in part because the latter often demands exclusive access to a cache line.

- Instruction reordering is invisible within a single threaded program.

- On most architectures, including x86-64 and ARM64,
  memory ordering is about preventing certain types of instruction reordering.

- On x86-64, every memory operation has acquire and release semantics, making it
  exactly as cheap or expensive as a relaxed operation.
  Everything other than stores and fences also has sequentially consistent semantics
  at no extra cost.

- On ARM64, acquire and release semantics are not as cheap as relaxed operations,
  but do include sequentially consistent semantics at no extra cost.
